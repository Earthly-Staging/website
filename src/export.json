Builds are always a source of frustration one way or another. They’re slow, brittle, too difficult to understand, inconsistent and difficult to iterate on.</p><p>In contrast, we found out that the number one reason people love Earthly so much is its ability to reproduce failures. Reproducibility is key, because it allows people to iterate on builds quickly on their laptops without having to worry that they will break when they push to CI.</p><p>Earthfiles represent a reproducibility guarantee, ensuring that your build will run the same way on all platforms - CI, your colleague’s laptop, Linux, Mac, Windows, etc. - regardless of any local specific toolchain.</p><p>People who have sought out reproducibility before Earthly have developed their own docker-based build scripts that essentially run most of the build within makeshift containers. The common problem with this approach is that the build requires constant fiddling to get right, still breaks occasionally on a colleague’s computer, and is poorly understood across wider teams.</p><p>Did you know that sed on a Mac is different from the sed on Linux distributions? So is find. And so is make. And a number of other tools we take for granted. Even on Linux alone, can you be sure that your colleagues are running the same version of Python or of Java? Is JDK even installed? If all of us were build gurus, experts in the likes of bash, makefile, and cross-system compatibility, maybe this wouldn’t be such a big issue. But we’re not.</p><p>These incompatibilities lead to significant inefficiencies in the software development lifecycle. Too often, teams don’t even run integration tests, because they have no idea how to build the projects belonging to other teams. Beyond the typical build scripts, there are often too many unwritten assumptions, so they just give up and leave it to be caught down the pipeline, in CI, UAT… or perhaps in production.</p><p>With Earthly, we believe we can make this process an order of magnitude better.</p><h2 id=\"how-does-it-work\">How does it work?</h2><p>Docker made containers friendlier to use and widely accessible, bringing container isolation into mainstream usage. In a similar spirit, Earthly follows in Docker’s footsteps, bringing together a number of important innovations into an easy-to-use package. We bring together Buildkit and OCI images and inspiration from Dockerfiles and Makefiles to make reproducible builds easier to get right and harder to get wrong.</p><p>Earthly is somewhat like a Makefile, where each target is fully isolated from one another - and, more importantly, isolated from the host environment. As they’re isolated, there is no way to depend on anything you have installed locally. To bring in OS-level dependencies, you install them as part of the build, the same way you would install them in a Dockerfile. In fact, the entire Docker Hub ecosystem can be leveraged in the build process.</p><p>In a way, Earthly completes Dockerfiles. While Dockerfiles allow you to define the make-up of Docker images, Earthfiles go beyond and also allow you to run unit tests, integration tests, or to output arbitrary files (eg binaries, artifacts, jars), not just images - all of which runs within a containerized environment, thus maintaining consistency of execution.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption\"><img src=\"/content/images/2020/09/Where-does-Earthly-fit---horizontal-v2--1-.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"Diagram of how Earthly integrates as a distinct layer between build systems and CI.

We replied within minutes to comments\nand pull requests (during work hours anyway), we set expectations about the\nrequired level of knowledge (you want to avoid beginners jumping on the\ngnarliest of issues) and we were welcoming in general.\n\nHacktoberfest is just getting started and we are looking forward to more\ncontributions\n[https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest]\n!","feature_image":"/content/images/2020/10/kelly-sikkema-4le7k9XVYjE-unsplash.jpg","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"5f58055ab2bf860039ab8273","created_at":"2020-10-09T20:50:28.000Z","updated_at":"2020-10-13T13:04:55.000Z","published_at":"2020-10-13T13:04:56.000Z","custom_excerpt":"Most contributions were from legitimate developers, excited at the opportunity to contribute to open-source.","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"5f91cf0e8f063a00394e8302","uuid":"66ad661c-4bd1-42aa-8dc2-700baf30a81c","title":"Building on Kubernetes: Ingress","slug":"building-on-kubernetes-ingress","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}],[\"soft-return\",\"\",{}]],\"cards\":[],\"markups\":[[\"strong\"]],\"sections\":[[1,\"p\",[[0,[0],1,\"What is an internal platform?\"]]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The internal platform is really the phrase I've always used in other places.

We'll extend it to pip install grpc tooling, and\ngenerate Python code:\n\nproto-py:\n  RUN apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip\n  RUN pip3 install grpcio grpcio-tools\n  COPY api.proto /defs\n  RUN mkdir /defs/py-api\n  RUN python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I /defs --python_out=/defs/py-api \\\n      --grpc_python_out=/defs/py-api /defs/api.proto\n  SAVE ARTIFACT ./py-api /py-pb AS LOCAL py-pb\n\n\nThen we'll create a client that reads command line arguments, and if the\nargument contains an equals sign, it will store the value in the server, and\notherwise it will retrieve the value from the server:\n\nimport sys\nimport grpc\n\nimport api_pb2\nimport api_pb2_grpc\n\naddr = '127.0.0.1:50051'\n\nif len(sys.argv) < 2:\n    print('program requires arguments in the form key, or key=value')\n    sys.exit(1)\n\nchannel = grpc.insecure_channel(addr)\nstub = api_pb2_grpc.KeyValueStub(channel)\n\nfor arg in sys.argv[1:]:\n    if '=' in arg:\n        # send a value to the server\n        key, value = arg.split('=')\n        try:\n            set_request = api_pb2.SetRequest(key=key, value=value)\n            set_response = stub.Set(set_request)\n        except grpc.RpcError as e:\n            print(f'failed to send key to server: {e.details}')\n        else:\n            print(f'sent \"{key}\" to server')\n    else:\n        # get a value from the server\n        key = arg\n        try:\n            get_request = api_pb2.GetRequest(key=key)\n            get_response = stub.Get(get_request)\n        except grpc.RpcError as e:\n            print(f'failed to get key from server: {e.details}')\n        else:\n            value = get_response.value\n            print(f'server returned value \"{value}\" for key \"{key}\"')\n\n\nWe then store this python code, along with the generated gRPC protobuf code with\nthe following Earthfile:\n\nFROM python:3\n\nRUN pip install grpcio protobuf pycodestyle\n\nWORKDIR /kvclient\n\ncode:\n    COPY client.py .\n    COPY ../proto+proto-go/go-pb kvapi\n\nlint:\n    FROM +code\n    RUN pycodestyle client.py\n\nkvclient-docker:\n    FROM +code\n    SAVE IMAGE as python-kvclient:latest\n\nall:\n    BUILD +lint\n    BUILD +kvclient-docker\n\n\nYou can give it a try for yourself with the example code:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/earthly/example-grpc-key-value-store.git\ncd example-grpc-key-value-store/python-client\nearth +kvclient-docker\n\n\nThen you can run it and set the weather to sunny with:\n\ndocker run --rm --network=host python-kvclient:latest python3 /kvclient/client.py weather=sunny\n\n\nAnd if all went well, you should see some output on both the client and server\nconsoles:\n\n# client output\nsent \"weather\" to server\n\n# server output\n2020/11/12 23:15:18 Listening on :50051\n2020/11/12 23:15:34 serving set request for key \"weather\" and value \"sunny\"\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFinal step: Implementing a gRPC client using Ruby\n\nWe've come a long ways with our Go and Python gRPC examples, but what if you\nalso wanted to include a Ruby gRPC client implementation too? Well let's extend\nour proto Earthfile to generate Ruby protobufs too:\n\nproto-rb:\n  RUN apt-get install -y ruby\n  RUN gem install grpc grpc-tools\n  COPY api.proto /defs\n  RUN mkdir /defs/rb-api\n  RUN grpc_tools_ruby_protoc -I /defs --ruby_out=/defs/rb-api --grpc_out=/defs/rb-api /defs/api.proto\n  SAVE ARTIFACT ./rb-api /rb-pb AS LOCAL rb-pb\n\n\nWe can then use this generated Ruby gRPC code with a simple ruby client example\nthat performs a get request for keys listed as command line arguments:\n\n$LOAD_PATH.unshift '.'\n\nrequire 'grpc'\nrequire 'api_pb'\nrequire 'api_services_pb'\n \nstub = Simplekeyvalue::KeyValue::Stub.new(\n  '127.0.0.1:50051', :this_channel_is_insecure\n)\n \nARGV.map do |arg|\n  request = Simplekeyvalue::GetRequest.new(key: arg)\n  response = stub.get(request)\n  puts response.value\nend\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/earthly/example-grpc-key-value-store.git\ncd example-grpc-key-value-store/ruby-client\nearth +kvclient-docker\n\n\nThen you can try querying the server to see what the weather was set to:\n\ndocker run --rm --network=host ruby-kvclient:latest ruby /kvclient/client.rb weather\n\n\nAnd if all went well, it'll tell you that it's sunny outside.\n\nSo there we go.  You can find the code for the server and the two clients in \ngithub here

Not surprised that this is happening a\ncouple of years later...my understanding is that private equity will tend\ntowards slowing/stopping development after acquisition to cut costs/headcount,\nand then squeeze the remaining value from what's left, so this is in-line with\nthat playbook.  - rpdillion on hacker news\n[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25340486]\nWhy it Matters\n> The open source movement runs on the heroic efforts of not enough people doing\ntoo much work. They need help. - CLIVE THOMPSON\n[https://www.wired.com/author/clive-thompson]\nMany open-source projects are still using Travis and open-source maintainers are\nnotoriously overworked.  Time spent migrating builds is time not spent on other\nthings.  Large well-maintained projects will likely quickly transition but for\nmany smaller projects, an abrupt change in a service they depend on is a huge\nchallenge. \n\nWhere To Move To\nIf you maintain an open-source project that uses TravisCI and are hoping to get\noff it, then assuming you have the time to migrate, there are actually many\nviable options.\n\nOption: Run Your Own Builds\nYou can find some scattered\n[https://medium.com/google-developers/how-to-run-travisci-locally-on-docker-822fc6b2db2e] \n instructions [https://stackoverflow.com/a/35972902] online\n[https://stackoverflow.com/a/35972902] for running Travis builds yourself. There\nare mixed reports on the stability and feasibility of this approach, but if your\nadventurous you could try to setup your own Travis CI build executor on your own\nhardware.\n\nA better option, if you want to run the builds on your own hardware is to look\nat something like Buildkite [https://buildkite.com/] or GitLab CI\n[https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/https://about.gitlab.com/stages-devops-lifecycle/continuous-integration/]\n.\n\nOption: Circle CI\nA better option is Circle CI, a Travis CI competitor which still offers a free\nplan. \n\nCircle CI offers 400,000 build credits per month to any open-source public\nrepository.  This is their free plan and limits concurrency to 1 job at a time.\nThey also have an easy GitHub integration and no application process.\n\nThey also allow use of the free plan with private repositories. This makes it a\ngreat choice if your project is not actually open-source.

Some have good parts, but are padded out with\nextra or outdated content. If you are going to buy an Udemy course, see what is\nrecommended by others or see if there is a previous author you like.\n\nThe Stephen Grider course its on my todo list specifically because I did\nStephen's Docker and Kubernetes course\n[https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/] in the\npast and enjoyed it.  I like his approach to teaching, which involves having you\ntyping out and running code as you go.\n\nBonus #2: Distributed Services with Go\nDistributed Services with Go\n[https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/] by Travis\nJeffery is currently in beta> \"For me the main motivator for learning go was that\nit was kinda like Erlang with regards to goroutines / message-passing\nconcurrency model, but with none of the performance drawbacks.\" Vlad A. Ionescu\n[https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu]\nEverything covered so far fits into the beginner and language intro category.\n But I mentioned at the beginning my interest in go was related to all the great\ncloud and distributed computing happening in Go.  That is what got me interested\nin Distributed Services with Go\n[https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/] by Travis\nJeffery.\n\n> \"Go has become the most popular language for building distributed services as\nshown by projects like Docker, Etcd, Vault, CockroachDB, Prometheus, and\nKubernetes. Despite the number of prominent projects such as these, however,\nthere’s no resource that teaches you why or how you can extend these projects or\nbuild your own.\" - Distributed Services with Go\nAt the time of writing the book is only in beta and I have only read the free\n1st chapter but it looks like exactly the type of book I need.\n\nBonus 3 to N: More Resources:\nWeb Resources\n * Go Lang Bootcamp [http://www.golangbootcamp.com/book/intro#cid1]\n * Learn Go with Tests [https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests]\n\nYoutube Talks\n * Go Concurrency Patterns by Rob Pike\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6kdp27TYZs]\n * Golang University 101 Playlist\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFejpH_tAHM&list=PLEcwzBXTPUE9V1o8mZdC9tNnRZaTgI-1P]\n * Golang University 201 - Intermediate Playlist\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeetIgNeIkc&list=PLEcwzBXTPUE_5m_JaMXmGEFgduH8EsuTs]\n * Golang University 301 - Advanced Playlist\n   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHRO5WQGh0k&list=PLEcwzBXTPUE8KvXRFmmfPEUmKoy9LfmAf]\n\nLists of Resources\n * A List of Go Resources [https://golangresources.com/]\n * A List of Go Advocates\n   [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zb9GCWPKeEJ4Dyn2TkT-O3wJ8AFc-IMxZzTugNCjr-8/edit]\n * Resources for new Go Programmers\n   [https://dave.cheney.net/resources-for-new-go-programmers]\n\nGo Books\n * Concurrency in Go: Tools and Techniques for Developers\n   [https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/30413199-concurrency-in-go]\n * The Go Programming Language\n   [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25080953-the-go-programming-language]\n * Head First Go [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36800891-head-first-go]","feature_image":"/content/images/2021/01/top3go.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-01-15T19:18:55.000Z","updated_at":"2021-01-15T20:00:09.000Z","published_at":"2021-01-15T20:00:09.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"60088c128a9ad30039b3d639","uuid":"6baeafb6-b802-473a-9565-5bcaa393c57e","title":"5 Blogs for Scala's Birthday","slug":"top-5-scala-blogs","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FCorecursive%2FOeXcNOsSzI.png?alt=media&token=065207e0-5221-4066-9fbc-7853dee1c742\",\"alt\":\"\",\"title\":\"\"}]],\"markups\":[[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_(programming_language)#History\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://alexn.org/blog/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://monix.io/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://typelevel.org/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://alexn.org/blog/2020/11/12/i-like-option-get.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://blog.softwaremill.com/tagged/scala\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://blog.softwaremill.com/java-15-through-the-eyes-of-a-scala-programmer-edde1ea04492\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://medium.com/scala-3\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://medium.com/scala-3/scala-3-dependent-types-part-i-273e9076e8f8\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://medium.com/scala-3/scala-3-dependent-types-part-ii-e7fc04dbfb08\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.47deg.com/blog/tags/scala/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.47deg.com/blog/game-of-life-scala/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.47deg.com/blog/tags/arrow/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.lihaoyi.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.handsonscala.com/\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/TheDeathofHypeWhatsNextforScala.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"https://www.lihaoyi.com/post/HowanOptimizingCompilerWorks.html\"]],[\"a\",[\"href\",\"http://scalatimes.com/\"]]],\"sections\":[[1,\"h1\",[]],[1,\"p\",[[0,[],0,\"The public release of Scala was \"],[0,[0],1,\"17 years ago\"],[0,[],0,\" today.

For example:\\n\\n```\\n├── lib\\n|   ├── lib\\n|   └── lib\\n├── lib\\n├── lib\\n├── lib\\n├── app\\n|   ├── lib\\n|   └── lib\\n|       ├── lib\\n|       └── lib\\n├── app\\n|   └── lib\\n└── big-project\\n|   ├── lib\\n|   ├── app\\n|   |   ├── lib\\n|   |   └── lib\\n|   └── app\\n|       └── lib\\n└── big-project\\n    ├── lib\\n    ├── lib\\n    ├── app\\n    |   └── lib\\n    └── app\\n        ├── lib\\n        └── lib\\n```\\n\\nEach `lib` and each `app` would contain various other sub-directories to house the source code itself, depending on the language it is written in. You get the idea.\\n\\nIn **polyrepo layout** (sometimes also called **multirepo layout**), on the other hand, the code is spread across... well multiple repositories. The degree to which the separation between logical pieces of code can vary from language to language and from style to style. [^1]\\n\\nHere's an example possible structure.\\n\\n```\\ngithub.com/myorg/app1\\n├── docs\\n├── examples\\n├── src\\n└── tests\\n\\ngithub.com/myorg/app2\\n├── docs\\n└── src\\n\\ngithub.com/myorg/app3\\n├── lib\\n|   └── src\\n├── lib\\n|   └── src\\n└── lib\\n    └── src\\n\\ngithub.com/myorg/lib1\\n└── src\\n```\\n\\nEach repository is focused on specific functionality. The structure of the repository is usually heavily influenced by the best practices of the language they host.\\n\\nA third alternative that some people use is the **hybrid repository layout**, whereby some components coexist in one or more monorepos, while others are separated in their own isolated, smaller repositories. Deciding which component goes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code, whether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.\\n\\n## Judging criteria\\n\\nThe structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering processes. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account for all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this article, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and characteristics:\\n\\n* Ease of importing\\n* Ease of contributing within and across projects\\n* Viewing diffs\\n* Structure of releases\\n* Builds and CI\\n* Open vs closed source\\n* Issue tracking\\n\\nFurther, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies used: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories and the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups that do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.\\n\\n## Let's take a look\\n\\n### Imports\\n\\n<!-- ![Containers seen from above](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Shipping containers seen from above\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nYou can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can be imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can be imported.\\n\\nFor example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package (directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically download any remote code and use it, via the new [modules features](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules). For Go, it is just as easy to use monorepos or polyrepos for code imports.\\n\\nIn Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you have to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in your Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package in the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can become unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with segmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate artifacts. See for example [multi-module Maven builds](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html).\\n\\nJavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a package from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be published to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript, however, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help out with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own separate `package.json`. [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is one such tool.\\n\\n**Verdict**: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an artifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across repositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a monorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each project and some communities have developed tools to help with that.\\n\\n### Contributions within the same project\\n\\n<!-- ![Software engineers collaborating](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Software engineers collaborating\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nMaking changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can span multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The developer experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.\\n\\nWhen viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history of changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull requests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed together; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific sub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the **History** link. If you have squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit message.\\n\\n![history](/content/images/2021/01/history.png)\\n\\n**Verdict**: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a polyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository rather than per-directory.\\n\\n### Contributions across projects\\n\\n<!-- ![Whiteboard collaboration](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Whiteboard collaboration\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nWhen making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant distinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo layout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns can be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could write code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API, DB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and contribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right [^2]. Atomic PRs also help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take shape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.\\n\\nIn polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct PRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to create the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in production (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each other).\\n\\nOne of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is that the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you change project B on the `main` branch and it is referenced by project A as `v1.2.3`, then you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of project B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B and update project A to now point to `v1.2.4`. This creates possible significant hurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get discouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.\\n\\nAnother possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call *delayed integration breaking*: the `main` branch of project B no longer works with project A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing to `v1.2.3` for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The first time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to B, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face when contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.\\n\\nDependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two projects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of maintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is often preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software relies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to evolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing the `main` branch version (in Java, this is known as the [`SNAPSHOT` version](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm)) as the dependency and thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a release, all `SNAPSHOT` references would need to be updated to pinned versions, however.\\n\\nAnother option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The support for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an [example of Scala Steward in action](https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165).\\n\\nFinally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered dependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other projects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup, this would be achieved through other means, such as [feature flagging](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html).\\n\\n**Verdict**: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo layout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and there is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In addition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.\\n\\n### Releases\\n\\n<!-- ![vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"A loaded cargo ship\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nOne of the key deciding factors of the source code layout is the structure of the releases. Depending on the deliverable type (library, app), the release might have multiple forms: an artifact, a language-specific package, a Docker image, an installer, etc.\\n\\nFor polyrepo layouts, you typically have one deliverable per repository. Whether that's a repository for microservice (e.g. deliverable: Docker image) or a library to perform some reusable functionality (e.g. deliverable: artifact), you typically only have one of these. This allows for each repository to have its own release cycle and to manage its own tags. This is especially great when different projects are managed by different teams, each with their own distinct style or release requirements.\\n\\nIn monorepo layouts, a typical tendency is to release everything at the same time. This is usually a mistake. It is not mandatory for monorepo setups to use this tactic, but it is an especially attractive one due to its apparent simplicity. In such a situation, the entire repository is tagged once for everything and pushed to production at the same time. This type of monolithic releasing can be very problematic for release agility and for maintaining a low mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR), in case of failures. In modern cloud development, releases need to happen weekly, daily or even on every merge to main. If something critical is broken, you also want to be able to ship fixes in less than an hour - maybe even less than 10 minutes. If you have a critical fix to push to production, but some unrelated test is failing in a different project, then a monolithic release cycle is getting in the way. In larger teams, monolithic releases are virtually impossible due to the ever-changing state of the build across projects. (The only thing a big bang guarantees is a big boom!)\\n\\nAn alternative approach to monolithic releases is for each project in a monorepo to have its own release cycle, despite coexisting in the same repository. This is key to allowing releases in monorepos to work properly. This might mean that you have independent tags for each project (e.g. `projecta-v1.2.3`, `projectb-v4.5.6`, `projectc-v7.8.9`) or no tags at all - just use `main` branch commit hashes - or a global auto-incrementing tag, that increases the version number on each commit (really, this last option is similar to using `main` commit hashes, except that more human-readable tags are used instead). In this case, each project executes a release based on the tags on independent schedules. This strategy relies on every merge to `main` to be considered as \\\"ready for production\\\", however, this is generally a good practice anyway.\\n\\nThe takeaway here is that for monorepos, you should not think that atomic PRs mean atomic releases. That is unrealistic in typical production environments. At the development level, yes you get to group together cross-cutting changes and merge as an atomic unit. At the release and production level, however, you still need another layer of indirection for allowing services to be updated independently. A very common such layer is the Docker image repository (or in more traditional environments, the artifactory). If each `main` branch build produces tagged Docker images, then these images can be pushed to production separately, according to independent schedules.\\n\\nOf course, with any set of related changes that go out independently across multiple microservices, care must be taken such that the changes are forwards and backwards compatible. In a polyrepo setup, the need for such compatibility guarantees is typically more intuitive to the developer. In a monorepo setup, however, the developer needs to be aware, again, that an atomic PR does not mean an atomic release.\\n\\n**Verdict**: Multiple factors can influence your decision here: team layout, release frequency requirements, MTTR requirements, level of cohesion of separate projects, and so on. Generally, polyrepos have the added benefit that the better engineering process decisions fall in place more naturally. In addition, the collection of tags usually make more sense for polyrepos.\\n\\n### Builds and CI\\n\\n<!-- ![Cranes above a construction project](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/danist-8Gg2Ne_uTcM-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/danist-8Gg2Ne_uTcM-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Cranes above a construction project\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nThe Achilles' heel of the monorepo is often the build. Most open-source build tooling handles builds project-by-project and does not deal with cross-project builds out of the box. For this reason, building multiple projects in a monorepo setup usually ends up in a complex do-it-yourself scripting endeavor. Where this usually falls apart is the ability to scale the size of the monorepo while maintaining reasonable build times (say less than 15 minutes).\\n\\nA number of monorepo build solutions exist out there, such as [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), [Pants](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) or [Buck](https://buck.build/). Some of them are very advanced, however, they require a huge commitment towards maintaining the setup and compromising interoperability with other open-source tools. These setups are preferable in very large development teams (1000+) where a dedicated build team can support specific needs of the engineering organization. Google, Facebook, and Twitter are examples of teams that have adopted such systems. For the rest of us, the options are more limited.\\n\\nOf the popular CI vendors (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Jenkins), few of them offer triggers based on [subdirectories](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths) (to help minimize unnecessary builds) and, in addition, caching needs to be handled manually for each project. In a monorepo setup, arguably CI caching is absolutely critical to get right in order to be able to scale the repository size, and yet no silver bullet type of solution exists.\\n\\nPolyrepos have generally been much better supported by build systems and by CIs. Dealing with each repository completely independently renders the scale issue irrelevant.\\n\\nHowever, there are still use-cases that cannot be easily accommodated: for example, if you make a change in a dependency, it is difficult to automatically rebuild all the dependants to ensure that nothing was affected. This additional verification needs to be performed manually in practice (and more often than not, it is never done at all). This particular limitation becomes apparent when needing to develop integration testing or end-to-end testing. A collection of microservices might be started altogether to perform a complex task as part of a test. If the test resides in repository A, and the microservices reside in repositories B, C, and D, then changes to B, C and D should automatically trigger the integration test to be re-run. To achieve this automated interoperability, each of these dependencies needs to be manually wired via [custom API calls](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event) (if these are supported by your CI vendor).\\n\\nA third possibility also exists, which I call the *hybrid layout*. Because monorepo builds are difficult to scale, some development teams reach a compromise in the middle: keep some projects grouped together in a single repository and others separately. Criteria for grouping together repositories may include language, level of inter-dependencies, team ownership, and others. As a distinct example, if a group of projects evolves closely together and there is high interoperability between them (for example, they use a set of common routines or data structures), it might make sense to group them in a single repository, while keeping everything else separately. If the monorepo does not grow to an endless number of projects, then traditional build tools meant for polyrepo setups could still fair well enough.\\n\\n**Verdict**: If you are a very large organization, systems like Bazel and others can offer a platform for very advanced build features in a monorepo setup - assuming that the entire engineering team adopts it. Small and medium organizations, or large organizations with fragmented builds generally benefit from polyrepo setups more, due to the existing build ecosystem available as open-source or commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS). Hybrid setups could also be used as a compromise, assuming the monorepo(s) are not too large to require special build considerations.\\n\\n#### A note on Earthly\\n\\n[Earthly](https://earthly.dev) supports cross-project builds for either monorepo and polyrepo layouts. It solves for some of the challenges outlined above. In fact, these challenges were the main [source of inspiration](/introducing-earthly-build-automation-for-the-container-era/) when Earthly was started.\\n\\n### Code ownership\\n\\n<!-- [![Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. — Melvin E. Conway](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/conway-quote.png)]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law)) -->\\n\\n<a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\\\"><img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/conway-quote.png\\\" alt=\\\"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure. — Melvin E. Conway\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\"></a>\\n\\nWhen deciding the source code layout, some key questions that come to mind are \\\"who is responsible for each piece of code\\\" and \\\"how can that be enforced\\\".\\n\\nGitHub features for managing access are far richer at the repository level - you can use [permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization) like **read**, **triage** (like read, but can also manage issues and PRs), **write**, **maintain** (like admin, but no destructive actions possible) and **admin**. In addition, you can also control a number of miscellaneous behavior independently, such as whether to allow squash commits or the specific way to enforce [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) (code reviews, CI passing, etc). A polyrepo setup gives each project the power to make such access decisions more independently and provides very fine-grained access controls that can be managed per-team.\\n\\nIf however, you would like to enforce certain rules across all teams, polyrepo setups can get in the way. Currently, the only way to enforce certain repository configurations across multiple repositories in GitHub is to use the API - so you have to develop your own in-house tooling to achieve that. Example use-cases include enforcing code reviews across the entire organization. Or enforcing squash commits.\\n\\nTo turn to monorepo setups, although you don't have the same level of permission granularity, GitHub provides a [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners) feature. Via CODEOWNERS, you could develop different access rights for each directory. The owners of that directory get push rights, while others need to seek code reviews from the owners. A common setup is to use a branch protection rule of one code review minimum, plus the code owners (sometimes a single code owner can satisfy both of these constraints). For example, if two microservices need to be changed to add a certain feature, a cross-cutting PR would require reviews from both teams in order to allow for that feature to make it into the main branch.\\n\\nIf for any reason certain parts of your codebase are highly confidential, there is no way to hide a subdirectory from the rest of the team in a monorepo setup.\\n\\n**Verdict**: It depends. If you would like to leave control of the engineering process enforcement to the individual teams, then polyrepo gives the most granular permission flexibility. If, on the other hand, you would like to enforce certain rules for everyone, a monorepo setup makes that the easiest.\\n\\n### Issue tracking\\n\\n<!-- ![Engineer placing sticky notes on the wall](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/you-x-ventures-Oalh2MojUuk-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/you-x-ventures-Oalh2MojUuk-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Engineer placing sticky notes on the wall\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nIn a polyrepo setup, each repository gets its own issue tracking. This is often preferable so that issues related to separate projects can be tracked in independent pools. Sometimes issues need to be tracked across projects too - in such cases, you could use another repository that is only used for issue tracking and where all the higher-level issues are tracked. The challenge with this setup is often the lack of discoverability of issues. The GitHub issue search across repositories is significantly inferior to the one that can be used within a single repository. In addition, it is hard to reuse certain labels, as each repository needs to (re-)define its own set.\\n\\nOn the other hand, in a monorepo setup, all issues are mixed in a single pool. This can become confusing after a certain scale, at which point you would likely need a more specialized issue tracking service. If the team is not too large, however, GitHub issues in a single monorepo can help with bringing everyone together.\\n\\n**Verdict**: For medium and large organizations, monorepo issue tracking does not scale well. For small organizations, monorepo issue tracking helps the team coordinate better.\\n\\n### Open-source\\n\\n<!-- ![Open hands arranged in a circle](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/sharon-mccutcheon-fkFNBCQ6kQA-unsplash.jpg) -->\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/01/sharon-mccutcheon-fkFNBCQ6kQA-unsplash.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Open hands arranged in a circle\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nIf your organization develops a mix of closed source and open-source code, there is absolutely no way to make a monorepo work. It is impossible to only show a subdirectory of the code to the outside world. You might think you could perhaps create a mirror of a subdirectory from the monorepo to a public repo, however, this does not go truly with the open-source spirit. How would you merge external contributions back to the main repository?\\n\\nIf you are hell-bent on monorepo, perhaps a hybrid approach is more appropriate for you: the open-source parts are separated in public repositories, while the closed source parts remain as part of the monorepo.\\n\\nPolyrepos on the other hand, fall much more naturally in the general pattern of typical open-source. In fact, to present open-source better to the external world, it's often best if the open-sourced software itself is scattered across repositories based on the [unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well): do one thing and do it well.\\n\\n**Verdict**: Polyrepos are more natural for splitting open-source code from closed source code. Hybrid setups allow largely monorepo setups to open-source some components. Pure monorepo setups are incompatible with mixed open and closed source use-cases.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you can see from the multitude of concerns and use-cases that need to be addressed by the source code layout, there is no single right answer. Usually, the decision depends on a wide-ranging set of factors including engineering culture, type of software being developed, team layout, team size, software architecture, and so on.\\n\\nIn general, open-source and COTS tooling is far better suited for polyrepo setups. Monorepo builds, in particular, are difficult to scale and sometimes require the adoption of specialized build technology that is very alien to the rest of us.\\n\\nAlthough the tooling to work with monorepos is more limited or sometimes more difficult to manage, it encourages cross-team collaboration as the hurdles specific to contributing across repositories and managing the dependency chain is lifted.\\n\\nHybrid setups tend to come as a compromise between the two approaches. They can be useful when a few projects present a higher level of cohesion: usually when they need to evolve together quickly and they are written in the same language. Hybrid setups can also be the answer when some parts need to be open-sourced and thus cannot be part of the main monorepo.\\n\\n### My own take\\n\\nAs a bit of personal opinion, I have always aimed to optimize for cross-team collaboration in my engineering teams. Developers don't naturally gravitate towards unknown code or unknown technologies, so anything you can do to encourage close collaboration helps bridge this gap. The result can be a really agile engineering organization.\\n\\nIt is usually the integration of components together that is the most time-consuming, the most prone to bugs, and the cause for unexpected surprises when working in production. If everyone is left to contribute in their own little box, they will not build the right tools and processes to effectively contribute across. As Andy Grove suggests in [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679762884/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_d.4bGbH1VS8VW) to design around the [limiting factor](https://charles.io/high-output-management/) (in this case, the limiting factor being cross-team contribution), I have always gravitated towards monorepo whenever possible. However, realistically pure monorepo hasn't always been truly feasible, so for one reason or another, we always ended up with a hybrid. This is one of the reasons I started [Earthly](https://earthly.dev).\\n\\n[^1]: In some extreme cases, the segmentation can be so aggressive, that you end up with microrepos: repositories that perform specific functions. See for example this [collection of micro NPM packages](https://github.com/parro-it/awesome-micro-npm-packages). There's a package for checking if an array is sorted?? Huh...\\n\\n[^2]: Care must be taken, however, as even though a PR is merged as a single atomic change, the way this lands in production is never atomic. Certain considerations still apply as usual.\\n\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>The decision of whether to use a monorepo or a polyrepo structure for your source code can be a very emotional (maybe even religious!) battle.

Deciding which component goes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code, whether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.</p>\n<h2 id=\"judgingcriteria\">Judging criteria</h2>\n<p>The structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering processes. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account for all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this article, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and characteristics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ease of importing</li>\n<li>Ease of contributing within and across projects</li>\n<li>Viewing diffs</li>\n<li>Structure of releases</li>\n<li>Builds and CI</li>\n<li>Open vs closed source</li>\n<li>Issue tracking</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies used: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories and the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups that do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.</p>\n<h2 id=\"letstakealook\">Let's take a look</h2>\n<h3 id=\"imports\">Imports</h3>\n<!-- ![Containers seen from above](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/chuttersnap-kyCNGGKCvyw-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Shipping containers seen from above\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>You can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can be imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can be imported.</p>\n<p>For example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package (directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically download any remote code and use it, via the new <a href=\"https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules\">modules features</a>. For Go, it is just as easy to use monorepos or polyrepos for code imports.</p>\n<p>In Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you have to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in your Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package in the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can become unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with segmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate artifacts. See for example <a href=\"https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html\">multi-module Maven builds</a>.</p>\n<p>JavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a package from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be published to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript, however, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help out with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own separate <code>package.json</code>. <a href=\"https://github.com/lerna/lerna\">Lerna</a> is one such tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an artifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across repositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a monorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each project and some communities have developed tools to help with that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contributionswithinthesameproject\">Contributions within the same project</h3>\n<!-- ![Software engineers collaborating](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/cowomen-cKQkMFzXHAI-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Software engineers collaborating\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>Making changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can span multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The developer experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.</p>\n<p>When viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history of changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull requests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed together; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific sub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the <strong>History</strong> link. If you have squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit message.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/history.png\" alt=\"history\"></p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a polyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository rather than per-directory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"contributionsacrossprojects\">Contributions across projects</h3>\n<!-- ![Whiteboard collaboration](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/kaleidico-26MJGnCM0Wc-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Whiteboard collaboration\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>When making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant distinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo layout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns can be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could write code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API, DB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and contribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\">[2]</a></sup>. Atomic PRs also help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take shape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.</p>\n<p>In polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct PRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to create the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in production (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each other).</p>\n<p>One of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is that the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you change project B on the <code>main</code> branch and it is referenced by project A as <code>v1.2.3</code>, then you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of project B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B and update project A to now point to <code>v1.2.4</code>. This creates possible significant hurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get discouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.</p>\n<p>Another possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call <em>delayed integration breaking</em>: the <code>main</code> branch of project B no longer works with project A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing to <code>v1.2.3</code> for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The first time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to B, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face when contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.</p>\n<p>Dependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two projects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of maintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is often preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software relies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to evolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing the <code>main</code> branch version (in Java, this is known as the <a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm\"><code>SNAPSHOT</code> version</a>) as the dependency and thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a release, all <code>SNAPSHOT</code> references would need to be updated to pinned versions, however.</p>\n<p>Another option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The support for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an <a href=\"https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165\">example of Scala Steward in action</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered dependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other projects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup, this would be achieved through other means, such as <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html\">feature flagging</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo layout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and there is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In addition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.</p>\n<h3 id=\"releases\">Releases</h3>\n<!-- ![vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/vidar-nordli-mathisen-y8TMoCzw87E-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"A loaded cargo ship\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>One of the key deciding factors of the source code layout is the structure of the releases. Depending on the deliverable type (library, app), the release might have multiple forms: an artifact, a language-specific package, a Docker image, an installer, etc.</p>\n<p>For polyrepo layouts, you typically have one deliverable per repository. Whether that's a repository for microservice (e.g. deliverable: Docker image) or a library to perform some reusable functionality (e.g. deliverable: artifact), you typically only have one of these. This allows for each repository to have its own release cycle and to manage its own tags. This is especially great when different projects are managed by different teams, each with their own distinct style or release requirements.</p>\n<p>In monorepo layouts, a typical tendency is to release everything at the same time. This is usually a mistake. It is not mandatory for monorepo setups to use this tactic, but it is an especially attractive one due to its apparent simplicity. In such a situation, the entire repository is tagged once for everything and pushed to production at the same time. This type of monolithic releasing can be very problematic for release agility and for maintaining a low mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR), in case of failures. In modern cloud development, releases need to happen weekly, daily or even on every merge to main. If something critical is broken, you also want to be able to ship fixes in less than an hour - maybe even less than 10 minutes. If you have a critical fix to push to production, but some unrelated test is failing in a different project, then a monolithic release cycle is getting in the way. In larger teams, monolithic releases are virtually impossible due to the ever-changing state of the build across projects. (The only thing a big bang guarantees is a big boom!)</p>\n<p>An alternative approach to monolithic releases is for each project in a monorepo to have its own release cycle, despite coexisting in the same repository. This is key to allowing releases in monorepos to work properly. This might mean that you have independent tags for each project (e.g. <code>projecta-v1.2.3</code>, <code>projectb-v4.5.6</code>, <code>projectc-v7.8.9</code>) or no tags at all - just use <code>main</code> branch commit hashes - or a global auto-incrementing tag, that increases the version number on each commit (really, this last option is similar to using <code>main</code> commit hashes, except that more human-readable tags are used instead). In this case, each project executes a release based on the tags on independent schedules. This strategy relies on every merge to <code>main</code> to be considered as &quot;ready for production&quot;, however, this is generally a good practice anyway.</p>\n<p>The takeaway here is that for monorepos, you should not think that atomic PRs mean atomic releases. That is unrealistic in typical production environments. At the development level, yes you get to group together cross-cutting changes and merge as an atomic unit. At the release and production level, however, you still need another layer of indirection for allowing services to be updated independently. A very common such layer is the Docker image repository (or in more traditional environments, the artifactory). If each <code>main</code> branch build produces tagged Docker images, then these images can be pushed to production separately, according to independent schedules.</p>\n<p>Of course, with any set of related changes that go out independently across multiple microservices, care must be taken such that the changes are forwards and backwards compatible. In a polyrepo setup, the need for such compatibility guarantees is typically more intuitive to the developer. In a monorepo setup, however, the developer needs to be aware, again, that an atomic PR does not mean an atomic release.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Multiple factors can influence your decision here: team layout, release frequency requirements, MTTR requirements, level of cohesion of separate projects, and so on. Generally, polyrepos have the added benefit that the better engineering process decisions fall in place more naturally. In addition, the collection of tags usually make more sense for polyrepos.</p>\n<h3 id=\"buildsandci\">Builds and CI</h3>\n<!-- ![Cranes above a construction project](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/danist-8Gg2Ne_uTcM-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/danist-8Gg2Ne_uTcM-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Cranes above a construction project\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>The Achilles' heel of the monorepo is often the build. Most open-source build tooling handles builds project-by-project and does not deal with cross-project builds out of the box. For this reason, building multiple projects in a monorepo setup usually ends up in a complex do-it-yourself scripting endeavor. Where this usually falls apart is the ability to scale the size of the monorepo while maintaining reasonable build times (say less than 15 minutes).</p>\n<p>A number of monorepo build solutions exist out there, such as <a href=\"https://bazel.build/\">Bazel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pantsbuild.org/\">Pants</a> or <a href=\"https://buck.build/\">Buck</a>. Some of them are very advanced, however, they require a huge commitment towards maintaining the setup and compromising interoperability with other open-source tools. These setups are preferable in very large development teams (1000+) where a dedicated build team can support specific needs of the engineering organization. Google, Facebook, and Twitter are examples of teams that have adopted such systems. For the rest of us, the options are more limited.</p>\n<p>Of the popular CI vendors (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Jenkins), few of them offer triggers based on <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths\">subdirectories</a> (to help minimize unnecessary builds) and, in addition, caching needs to be handled manually for each project. In a monorepo setup, arguably CI caching is absolutely critical to get right in order to be able to scale the repository size, and yet no silver bullet type of solution exists.</p>\n<p>Polyrepos have generally been much better supported by build systems and by CIs. Dealing with each repository completely independently renders the scale issue irrelevant.</p>\n<p>However, there are still use-cases that cannot be easily accommodated: for example, if you make a change in a dependency, it is difficult to automatically rebuild all the dependants to ensure that nothing was affected. This additional verification needs to be performed manually in practice (and more often than not, it is never done at all). This particular limitation becomes apparent when needing to develop integration testing or end-to-end testing. A collection of microservices might be started altogether to perform a complex task as part of a test. If the test resides in repository A, and the microservices reside in repositories B, C, and D, then changes to B, C and D should automatically trigger the integration test to be re-run. To achieve this automated interoperability, each of these dependencies needs to be manually wired via <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event\">custom API calls</a> (if these are supported by your CI vendor).</p>\n<p>A third possibility also exists, which I call the <em>hybrid layout</em>. Because monorepo builds are difficult to scale, some development teams reach a compromise in the middle: keep some projects grouped together in a single repository and others separately. Criteria for grouping together repositories may include language, level of inter-dependencies, team ownership, and others. As a distinct example, if a group of projects evolves closely together and there is high interoperability between them (for example, they use a set of common routines or data structures), it might make sense to group them in a single repository, while keeping everything else separately. If the monorepo does not grow to an endless number of projects, then traditional build tools meant for polyrepo setups could still fair well enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: If you are a very large organization, systems like Bazel and others can offer a platform for very advanced build features in a monorepo setup - assuming that the entire engineering team adopts it. Small and medium organizations, or large organizations with fragmented builds generally benefit from polyrepo setups more, due to the existing build ecosystem available as open-source or commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS). Hybrid setups could also be used as a compromise, assuming the monorepo(s) are not too large to require special build considerations.</p>\n<h4 id=\"anoteonearthly\">A note on Earthly</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://earthly.dev\">Earthly</a> supports cross-project builds for either monorepo and polyrepo layouts.

In addition, you can also control a number of miscellaneous behavior independently, such as whether to allow squash commits or the specific way to enforce <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule\">branch protection</a> (code reviews, CI passing, etc). A polyrepo setup gives each project the power to make such access decisions more independently and provides very fine-grained access controls that can be managed per-team.</p>\n<p>If however, you would like to enforce certain rules across all teams, polyrepo setups can get in the way. Currently, the only way to enforce certain repository configurations across multiple repositories in GitHub is to use the API - so you have to develop your own in-house tooling to achieve that. Example use-cases include enforcing code reviews across the entire organization. Or enforcing squash commits.</p>\n<p>To turn to monorepo setups, although you don't have the same level of permission granularity, GitHub provides a <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners\">CODEOWNERS</a> feature. Via CODEOWNERS, you could develop different access rights for each directory. The owners of that directory get push rights, while others need to seek code reviews from the owners. A common setup is to use a branch protection rule of one code review minimum, plus the code owners (sometimes a single code owner can satisfy both of these constraints). For example, if two microservices need to be changed to add a certain feature, a cross-cutting PR would require reviews from both teams in order to allow for that feature to make it into the main branch.</p>\n<p>If for any reason certain parts of your codebase are highly confidential, there is no way to hide a subdirectory from the rest of the team in a monorepo setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: It depends. If you would like to leave control of the engineering process enforcement to the individual teams, then polyrepo gives the most granular permission flexibility. If, on the other hand, you would like to enforce certain rules for everyone, a monorepo setup makes that the easiest.</p>\n<h3 id=\"issuetracking\">Issue tracking</h3>\n<!-- ![Engineer placing sticky notes on the wall](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/you-x-ventures-Oalh2MojUuk-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/you-x-ventures-Oalh2MojUuk-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Engineer placing sticky notes on the wall\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>In a polyrepo setup, each repository gets its own issue tracking. This is often preferable so that issues related to separate projects can be tracked in independent pools. Sometimes issues need to be tracked across projects too - in such cases, you could use another repository that is only used for issue tracking and where all the higher-level issues are tracked. The challenge with this setup is often the lack of discoverability of issues. The GitHub issue search across repositories is significantly inferior to the one that can be used within a single repository. In addition, it is hard to reuse certain labels, as each repository needs to (re-)define its own set.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in a monorepo setup, all issues are mixed in a single pool. This can become confusing after a certain scale, at which point you would likely need a more specialized issue tracking service. If the team is not too large, however, GitHub issues in a single monorepo can help with bringing everyone together.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: For medium and large organizations, monorepo issue tracking does not scale well. For small organizations, monorepo issue tracking helps the team coordinate better.</p>\n<h3 id=\"opensource\">Open-source</h3>\n<!-- ![Open hands arranged in a circle](https://blog.earthly.dev/content/images/2021/01/sharon-mccutcheon-fkFNBCQ6kQA-unsplash.jpg) -->\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/01/sharon-mccutcheon-fkFNBCQ6kQA-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"Open hands arranged in a circle\" style=\"max-width:800px;width:100%\">\n<p>If your organization develops a mix of closed source and open-source code, there is absolutely no way to make a monorepo work. It is impossible to only show a subdirectory of the code to the outside world. You might think you could perhaps create a mirror of a subdirectory from the monorepo to a public repo, however, this does not go truly with the open-source spirit. How would you merge external contributions back to the main repository?</p>\n<p>If you are hell-bent on monorepo, perhaps a hybrid approach is more appropriate for you: the open-source parts are separated in public repositories, while the closed source parts remain as part of the monorepo.</p>\n<p>Polyrepos on the other hand, fall much more naturally in the general pattern of typical open-source. In fact, to present open-source better to the external world, it's often best if the open-sourced software itself is scattered across repositories based on the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well\">unix philosophy</a>: do one thing and do it well.</p>\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Polyrepos are more natural for splitting open-source code from closed source code. Hybrid setups allow largely monorepo setups to open-source some components. Pure monorepo setups are incompatible with mixed open and closed source use-cases.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you can see from the multitude of concerns and use-cases that need to be addressed by the source code layout, there is no single right answer. Usually, the decision depends on a wide-ranging set of factors including engineering culture, type of software being developed, team layout, team size, software architecture, and so on.</p>\n<p>In general, open-source and COTS tooling is far better suited for polyrepo setups. Monorepo builds, in particular, are difficult to scale and sometimes require the adoption of specialized build technology that is very alien to the rest of us.</p>\n<p>Although the tooling to work with monorepos is more limited or sometimes more difficult to manage, it encourages cross-team collaboration as the hurdles specific to contributing across repositories and managing the dependency chain is lifted.</p>\n<p>Hybrid setups tend to come as a compromise between the two approaches. They can be useful when a few projects present a higher level of cohesion: usually when they need to evolve together quickly and they are written in the same language. Hybrid setups can also be the answer when some parts need to be open-sourced and thus cannot be part of the main monorepo.</p>\n<h3 id=\"myowntake\">My own take</h3>\n<p>As a bit of personal opinion, I have always aimed to optimize for cross-team collaboration in my engineering teams. Developers don't naturally gravitate towards unknown code or unknown technologies, so anything you can do to encourage close collaboration helps bridge this gap. The result can be a really agile engineering organization.</p>\n<p>It is usually the integration of components together that is the most time-consuming, the most prone to bugs, and the cause for unexpected surprises when working in production. If everyone is left to contribute in their own little box, they will not build the right tools and processes to effectively contribute across.

On its\nsurface, it's not much different than \"tabs vs spaces\" or \"vim vs emacs\". Or is\nit?\n\nIn the following, I will attempt to draw objective, logical arguments for both\napproaches and also throw in a very popular third option: the hybrid.\n\nQuick intro\nThe monorepo layout consists of a single code repository where multiple projects\ncoexist in a hierarchical directory structure. For example:\n\n├── lib\n|   ├── lib\n|   └── lib\n├── lib\n├── lib\n├── lib\n├── app\n|   ├── lib\n|   └── lib\n|       ├── lib\n|       └── lib\n├── app\n|   └── lib\n└── big-project\n|   ├── lib\n|   ├── app\n|   |   ├── lib\n|   |   └── lib\n|   └── app\n|       └── lib\n└── big-project\n    ├── lib\n    ├── lib\n    ├── app\n    |   └── lib\n    └── app\n        ├── lib\n        └── lib\n\n\nEach lib and each app would contain various other sub-directories to house the\nsource code itself, depending on the language it is written in. You get the\nidea.\n\nIn polyrepo layout (sometimes also called multirepo layout), on the other hand,\nthe code is spread across... well multiple repositories. The degree to which the\nseparation between logical pieces of code can vary from language to language and\nfrom style to style.

The structure of the\nrepository is usually heavily influenced by the best practices of the language\nthey host.\n\nA third alternative that some people use is the hybrid repository layout,\nwhereby some components coexist in one or more monorepos, while others are\nseparated in their own isolated, smaller repositories. Deciding which component\ngoes where may be influenced by team ownership, the language of the code,\nwhether the component is open or closed source, and other factors.\n\nJudging criteria\nThe structure of your source code empowers or impedes various engineering\nprocesses. It is the lifeblood of your technical product and it needs to account\nfor all the possible ways it can be used. To avoid boiling the ocean with this\narticle, however, we will focus on the most popular use-cases and\ncharacteristics:\n\n * Ease of importing\n * Ease of contributing within and across projects\n * Viewing diffs\n * Structure of releases\n * Builds and CI\n * Open vs closed source\n * Issue tracking\n\nFurther, we will make certain assumptions about the underlying technologies\nused: for example, we will assume that you are using GitHub for the repositories\nand the issue tracking. The considerations typically apply to most other setups\nthat do not necessarily use these technologies. They work similarly.\n\nLet's take a look\nImports\nYou can't talk about the code layout, without looking primarily at how code can\nbe imported and reused. Different languages can vary wildly in the way code can\nbe imported.\n\nFor example, in Go, you have the freedom to reference just about any package\n(directory) in any repository with ease. There are mechanisms to automatically\ndownload any remote code and use it, via the new modules features\n[https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules]. For Go, it is just as easy to use\nmonorepos or polyrepos for code imports.\n\nIn Java, on the other hand, you cannot simply import a GitHub repository - you\nhave to first publish a JAR to an artifactory, and then reference that JAR in\nyour Java-specific build file. So it becomes far easier to reference a package\nin the same repository than across repositories setup-wise. But the code can\nbecome unwieldy. For this reason, some Java monorepo layouts tend to stick with\nsegmenting the code across separate modules, each possibly producing separate\nartifacts. See for example multi-module Maven builds\n[https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html].\n\nJavaScript tends to be spread across multiple repositories typically. To use a\npackage from one repository to another, however, the package needs to be\npublished to NPM. It's less popular to use a monorepo layout with JavaScript,\nhowever, if you would like to experiment, there are a number of tools to help\nout with the directory organization, such that each project gets its own\nseparate package.json. Lerna [https://github.com/lerna/lerna] is one such tool.\n\nVerdict: It depends heavily on the language. Even if the language requires an\nartifactory or a package repository in the middle when referencing code across\nrepositories, it still seems like polyrepos are more popular. When using a\nmonorepo layout, it's often preferable to create distinct modules of each\nproject and some communities have developed tools to help with that.\n\nContributions within the same project\nMaking changes to source code can be isolated to one specific area, or it can\nspan multiple functional concerns and thus need to cross-project boundaries. The\ndeveloper experience may vary depending on how the code is laid out.\n\nWhen viewing changes to a single project, it is easier to visualize the history\nof changes in GitHub in a polyrepo setup, by simply navigating the list of pull\nrequests. In a monorepo setup, however, all the pull requests are mixed\ntogether; your best bet, in that case, is to first open the specific\nsub-directory you are interested in and then clicking the History link. If you\nhave squash merges enabled, you can easily navigate the PR from the commit\nmessage.\n\n\n\nVerdict: Managing contributions within the same project is easier with a\npolyrepo layout, as it is easier to track the history of changes per-repository\nrather than per-directory.\n\nContributions across projects\nWhen making contributions across multiple projects, there is a significant\ndistinction. Arguably, this is one of the main reasons to use the monorepo\nlayout. When everything is in a single repository, many cross-cutting concerns\ncan be modified and submitted as a single, atomic PR. For example, you could\nwrite code for a new feature and make adjustments end-to-end: UI, backend, API,\nDB schema migration, documentation, etc. The simplicity of the dev-test and\ncontribution process really shines in monorepos, when done right [2]. Atomic PRs\nalso help to visualize changes for review. It is easier to see a feature take\nshape when the changes across projects are visible in one place.\n\nIn polyrepos, cross-cutting changes need to be performed as separate distinct\nPRs. Although it is more work to open separate PRs, it's sometimes useful to\ncreate the mindfulness that the components are landing asynchronously in\nproduction (for example, if these are separate microservices talking to each\nother).\n\nOne of the challenging aspects of contributing across multiple repositories is\nthat the dependencies are often referenced as a pinned version number. If you\nchange project B on the main branch and it is referenced by project A as v1.2.3,\nthen you will need to work out a way to test project A with the latest of\nproject B for development, or, as a workaround, perform a release of project B\nand update project A to now point to v1.2.4. This creates possible significant\nhurdles for the developer to go through and for this reason, developers get\ndiscouraged to contribute to other team's codebases unless they really have to.\n\nAnother possible side-effect of dependency version pinning is what I call \ndelayed integration breaking: the main branch of project B no longer works with\nproject A due to some change performed in the past. Project A has been pointing\nto v1.2.3 for a long time, while project B has been evolving independently. The\nfirst time this is discovered is when a developer attempts to make a change to\nB, which is needed in A. This, again, contributes to the hurdles developers face\nwhen contributing across repositories and creates hidden technical debt.\n\nDependency version pinning is not a bad thing in and of itself. If the two\nprojects are well separated and the team maintaining the dependency is aware of\nmaintaining compatibility (and enforces this with proper testing), then this is\noften preferred. After all, the way we typically consume open-source software\nrelies on this model and it is very successful. However, if two projects need to\nevolve together tightly, then a possible alternative might be always referencing\nthe main branch version (in Java, this is known as the SNAPSHOT version\n[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/maven/maven_snapshots.htm]) as the dependency\nand thus being able to catch integration regressions much more quickly. During a\nrelease, all SNAPSHOT references would need to be updated to pinned versions,\nhowever.\n\nAnother option might be to use a bot that regularly updates dependencies. The\nsupport for such a bot may be language-specific, however. Here's an example of\nScala Steward in action [https://github.com/tenable/Kastle/pull/165].\n\nFinally, in polyrepo setups developers have the option to use staggered\ndependency upgrades: the ability to update a dependency gradually across other\nprojects and thus control the way a change is rolled out. In a monorepo setup,\nthis would be achieved through other means, such as feature flagging\n[https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html].\n\nVerdict: Managing contributions across projects is usually easier in a monorepo\nlayout, as PRs can make changes across several components at the same time and\nthere is no need to constantly update the referenced version of dependencies. In\naddition, integration breakages are obvious immediately.\n\nReleases\nOne of the key deciding factors of the source code layout is the structure of\nthe releases. Depending on the deliverable type (library, app), the release\nmight have multiple forms: an artifact, a language-specific package, a Docker\nimage, an installer, etc.\n\nFor polyrepo layouts, you typically have one deliverable per repository. Whether\nthat's a repository for microservice (e.g. deliverable: Docker image) or a\nlibrary to perform some reusable functionality (e.g. deliverable: artifact), you\ntypically only have one of these. This allows for each repository to have its\nown release cycle and to manage its own tags. This is especially great when\ndifferent projects are managed by different teams, each with their own distinct\nstyle or release requirements.\n\nIn monorepo layouts, a typical tendency is to release everything at the same\ntime. This is usually a mistake. It is not mandatory for monorepo setups to use\nthis tactic, but it is an especially attractive one due to its apparent\nsimplicity. In such a situation, the entire repository is tagged once for\neverything and pushed to production at the same time. This type of monolithic\nreleasing can be very problematic for release agility and for maintaining a low\nmean-time-to-resolution (MTTR), in case of failures. In modern cloud\ndevelopment, releases need to happen weekly, daily or even on every merge to\nmain. If something critical is broken, you also want to be able to ship fixes in\nless than an hour - maybe even less than 10 minutes. If you have a critical fix\nto push to production, but some unrelated test is failing in a different\nproject, then a monolithic release cycle is getting in the way. In larger teams,\nmonolithic releases are virtually impossible due to the ever-changing state of\nthe build across projects. (The only thing a big bang guarantees is a big boom!)\n\nAn alternative approach to monolithic releases is for each project in a monorepo\nto have its own release cycle, despite coexisting in the same repository. This\nis key to allowing releases in monorepos to work properly. This might mean that\nyou have independent tags for each project (e.g. projecta-v1.2.3, \nprojectb-v4.5.6, projectc-v7.8.9) or no tags at all - just use main branch\ncommit hashes - or a global auto-incrementing tag, that increases the version\nnumber on each commit (really, this last option is similar to using main commit\nhashes, except that more human-readable tags are used instead). In this case,\neach project executes a release based on the tags on independent schedules. This\nstrategy relies on every merge to main to be considered as \"ready for\nproduction\", however, this is generally a good practice anyway.\n\nThe takeaway here is that for monorepos, you should not think that atomic PRs\nmean atomic releases. That is unrealistic in typical production environments. At\nthe development level, yes you get to group together cross-cutting changes and\nmerge as an atomic unit. At the release and production level, however, you still\nneed another layer of indirection for allowing services to be updated\nindependently. A very common such layer is the Docker image repository (or in\nmore traditional environments, the artifactory). If each main branch build\nproduces tagged Docker images, then these images can be pushed to production\nseparately, according to independent schedules.\n\nOf course, with any set of related changes that go out independently across\nmultiple microservices, care must be taken such that the changes are forwards\nand backwards compatible. In a polyrepo setup, the need for such compatibility\nguarantees is typically more intuitive to the developer. In a monorepo setup,\nhowever, the developer needs to be aware, again, that an atomic PR does not mean\nan atomic release.\n\nVerdict: Multiple factors can influence your decision here: team layout, release\nfrequency requirements, MTTR requirements, level of cohesion of separate\nprojects, and so on. Generally, polyrepos have the added benefit that the better\nengineering process decisions fall in place more naturally. In addition, the\ncollection of tags usually make more sense for polyrepos.\n\nBuilds and CI\nThe Achilles' heel of the monorepo is often the build. Most open-source build\ntooling handles builds project-by-project and does not deal with cross-project\nbuilds out of the box. For this reason, building multiple projects in a monorepo\nsetup usually ends up in a complex do-it-yourself scripting endeavor. Where this\nusually falls apart is the ability to scale the size of the monorepo while\nmaintaining reasonable build times (say less than 15 minutes).\n\nA number of monorepo build solutions exist out there, such as Bazel\n[https://bazel.build/], Pants [https://www.pantsbuild.org/] or Buck\n[https://buck.build/]. Some of them are very advanced, however, they require a\nhuge commitment towards maintaining the setup and compromising interoperability\nwith other open-source tools. These setups are preferable in very large\ndevelopment teams (1000+) where a dedicated build team can support specific\nneeds of the engineering organization. Google, Facebook, and Twitter are\nexamples of teams that have adopted such systems. For the rest of us, the\noptions are more limited.\n\nOf the popular CI vendors (GitHub Actions, Circle CI, Jenkins), few of them\noffer triggers based on subdirectories\n[https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths] \n(to help minimize unnecessary builds) and, in addition, caching needs to be\nhandled manually for each project. In a monorepo setup, arguably CI caching is\nabsolutely critical to get right in order to be able to scale the repository\nsize, and yet no silver bullet type of solution exists.\n\nPolyrepos have generally been much better supported by build systems and by CIs.\nDealing with each repository completely independently renders the scale issue\nirrelevant.\n\nHowever, there are still use-cases that cannot be easily accommodated: for\nexample, if you make a change in a dependency, it is difficult to automatically\nrebuild all the dependants to ensure that nothing was affected. This additional\nverification needs to be performed manually in practice (and more often than\nnot, it is never done at all). This particular limitation becomes apparent when\nneeding to develop integration testing or end-to-end testing. A collection of\nmicroservices might be started altogether to perform a complex task as part of a\ntest. If the test resides in repository A, and the microservices reside in\nrepositories B, C, and D, then changes to B, C and D should automatically\ntrigger the integration test to be re-run. To achieve this automated\ninteroperability, each of these dependencies needs to be manually wired via \ncustom API calls\n[https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event] \n(if these are supported by your CI vendor).\n\nA third possibility also exists, which I call the hybrid layout. Because\nmonorepo builds are difficult to scale, some development teams reach a\ncompromise in the middle: keep some projects grouped together in a single\nrepository and others separately. Criteria for grouping together repositories\nmay include language, level of inter-dependencies, team ownership, and others.\nAs a distinct example, if a group of projects evolves closely together and there\nis high interoperability between them (for example, they use a set of common\nroutines or data structures), it might make sense to group them in a single\nrepository, while keeping everything else separately. If the monorepo does not\ngrow to an endless number of projects, then traditional build tools meant for\npolyrepo setups could still fair well enough.\n\nVerdict: If you are a very large organization, systems like Bazel and others can\noffer a platform for very advanced build features in a monorepo setup - assuming\nthat the entire engineering team adopts it. Small and medium organizations, or\nlarge organizations with fragmented builds generally benefit from polyrepo\nsetups more, due to the existing build ecosystem available as open-source or\ncommercial-off-the-shelf (COTS). Hybrid setups could also be used as a\ncompromise, assuming the monorepo(s) are not too large to require special build\nconsiderations.\n\nA note on Earthly\nEarthly [https://earthly.dev] supports cross-project builds for either monorepo\nand polyrepo layouts. It solves for some of the challenges outlined above. In\nfact, these challenges were the main source of inspiration\n[/introducing-earthly-build-automation-for-the-container-era/] when Earthly was\nstarted.\n\nCode ownership\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law]\n\nWhen deciding the source code layout, some key questions that come to mind are\n\"who is responsible for each piece of code\" and \"how can that be enforced\".\n\nGitHub features for managing access are far richer at the repository level - you\ncan use permissions\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization] \nlike read, triage (like read, but can also manage issues and PRs), write, \nmaintain (like admin, but no destructive actions possible) and admin. In\naddition, you can also control a number of miscellaneous behavior independently,\nsuch as whether to allow squash commits or the specific way to enforce branch\nprotection\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-a-branch-protection-rule] \n(code reviews, CI passing, etc). A polyrepo setup gives each project the power\nto make such access decisions more independently and provides very fine-grained\naccess controls that can be managed per-team.\n\nIf however, you would like to enforce certain rules across all teams, polyrepo\nsetups can get in the way. Currently, the only way to enforce certain repository\nconfigurations across multiple repositories in GitHub is to use the API - so you\nhave to develop your own in-house tooling to achieve that. Example use-cases\ninclude enforcing code reviews across the entire organization. Or enforcing\nsquash commits.\n\nTo turn to monorepo setups, although you don't have the same level of permission\ngranularity, GitHub provides a CODEOWNERS\n[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners] \nfeature. Via CODEOWNERS, you could develop different access rights for each\ndirectory. The owners of that directory get push rights, while others need to\nseek code reviews from the owners. A common setup is to use a branch protection\nrule of one code review minimum, plus the code owners (sometimes a single code\nowner can satisfy both of these constraints). For example, if two microservices\nneed to be changed to add a certain feature, a cross-cutting PR would require\nreviews from both teams in order to allow for that feature to make it into the\nmain branch.\n\nIf for any reason certain parts of your codebase are highly confidential, there\nis no way to hide a subdirectory from the rest of the team in a monorepo setup.\n\nVerdict: It depends. If you would like to leave control of the engineering\nprocess enforcement to the individual teams, then polyrepo gives the most\ngranular permission flexibility. If, on the other hand, you would like to\nenforce certain rules for everyone, a monorepo setup makes that the easiest.\n\nIssue tracking\nIn a polyrepo setup, each repository gets its own issue tracking. This is often\npreferable so that issues related to separate projects can be tracked in\nindependent pools. Sometimes issues need to be tracked across projects too - in\nsuch cases, you could use another repository that is only used for issue\ntracking and where all the higher-level issues are tracked. The challenge with\nthis setup is often the lack of discoverability of issues. The GitHub issue\nsearch across repositories is significantly inferior to the one that can be used\nwithin a single repository. In addition, it is hard to reuse certain labels, as\neach repository needs to (re-)define its own set.\n\nOn the other hand, in a monorepo setup, all issues are mixed in a single pool.\nThis can become confusing after a certain scale, at which point you would likely\nneed a more specialized issue tracking service. If the team is not too large,\nhowever, GitHub issues in a single monorepo can help with bringing everyone\ntogether.\n\nVerdict: For medium and large organizations, monorepo issue tracking does not\nscale well. For small organizations, monorepo issue tracking helps the team\ncoordinate better.\n\nOpen-source\nIf your organization develops a mix of closed source and open-source code, there\nis absolutely no way to make a monorepo work. It is impossible to only show a\nsubdirectory of the code to the outside world. You might think you could perhaps\ncreate a mirror of a subdirectory from the monorepo to a public repo, however,\nthis does not go truly with the open-source spirit. How would you merge external\ncontributions back to the main repository?\n\nIf you are hell-bent on monorepo, perhaps a hybrid approach is more appropriate\nfor you: the open-source parts are separated in public repositories, while the\nclosed source parts remain as part of the monorepo.\n\nPolyrepos on the other hand, fall much more naturally in the general pattern of\ntypical open-source. In fact, to present open-source better to the external\nworld, it's often best if the open-sourced software itself is scattered across\nrepositories based on the unix philosophy\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy#Do_One_Thing_and_Do_It_Well]: do\none thing and do it well.\n\nVerdict: Polyrepos are more natural for splitting open-source code from closed\nsource code. Hybrid setups allow largely monorepo setups to open-source some\ncomponents. Pure monorepo setups are incompatible with mixed open and closed\nsource use-cases.\n\nConclusion\nAs you can see from the multitude of concerns and use-cases that need to be\naddressed by the source code layout, there is no single right answer. Usually,\nthe decision depends on a wide-ranging set of factors including engineering\nculture, type of software being developed, team layout, team size, software\narchitecture, and so on.\n\nIn general, open-source and COTS tooling is far better suited for polyrepo\nsetups. Monorepo builds, in particular, are difficult to scale and sometimes\nrequire the adoption of specialized build technology that is very alien to the\nrest of us.\n\nAlthough the tooling to work with monorepos is more limited or sometimes more\ndifficult to manage, it encourages cross-team collaboration as the hurdles\nspecific to contributing across repositories and managing the dependency chain\nis lifted.\n\nHybrid setups tend to come as a compromise between the two approaches. They can\nbe useful when a few projects present a higher level of cohesion: usually when\nthey need to evolve together quickly and they are written in the same language.\nHybrid setups can also be the answer when some parts need to be open-sourced and\nthus cannot be part of the main monorepo.\n\nMy own take\nAs a bit of personal opinion, I have always aimed to optimize for cross-team\ncollaboration in my engineering teams. Developers don't naturally gravitate\ntowards unknown code or unknown technologies, so anything you can do to\nencourage close collaboration helps bridge this gap. The result can be a really\nagile engineering organization.\n\nIt is usually the integration of components together that is the most\ntime-consuming, the most prone to bugs, and the cause for unexpected surprises\nwhen working in production. If everyone is left to contribute in their own\nlittle box, they will not build the right tools and processes to effectively\ncontribute across. As Andy Grove suggests in High Output Management\n[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679762884/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_d.4bGbH1VS8VW] to\ndesign around the limiting factor [https://charles.io/high-output-management/] \n(in this case, the limiting factor being cross-team contribution), I have always\ngravitated towards monorepo whenever possible. However, realistically pure\nmonorepo hasn't always been truly feasible, so for one reason or another, we\nalways ended up with a hybrid. This is one of the reasons I started Earthly\n[https://earthly.dev].\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1.

They can't because they need a Linux host to run.  Instead, they run on the Linux Container Host, a VM that Docker Desktop manages.</p><p>To see the docker daemon's incoming and outgoing requests, we need to get our proxy settings and our certificate authority into that VM.</p><blockquote>Before we proceed, we need to clear the proxy settings on the host network connection.

Being able to scan through and observe HTTP protocol traffic easily is\na great debugging aid.\n\nThis guide will walk you through installing and using mitmproxy to capture HTTPS\nrequests.  We will start with macOS traffic capture, then touch on Linux and\nWindows and then finally show how to capture docker daemon traffic and docker\ncontainer traffic.\n\nWhat is mitmproxy?\nmitmproxy is a command-line tool that acts as a HTTP and HTTPS proxy and records\nall the traffic.  You can easily see what requests are being made and even\nreplay them.  It's great for diagnosing problems.\n\nInstalling it\nOn Mac, mitmproxy is easy to install with brew:\n\nbrew install mitmproxy\n\n\nOn Windows and Linux, download the binary release\n[https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/overview-installation/] and place it\nsomewhere in your path.\n\n#1 Start it up\nTo start up mitmproxy, type mitmproxy, and it will start up bound to port 8080.\n\n>mitmproxy\n\n\nThe command-line interface (CLI) has VIM-like keybindings. q will quit, and\narrow keys or h, j, k, l will move you up and down through the request list. ? \nwill load the help, and <<enter>> will drill in on a specific request.\n\nhelp menu for mitmproxymitmproxy also has a web interface if you prefer the\nmouse over VIM keybindings. The advanced functionality is a bit more\ndiscoverable in the web interface, but the CLI version is convenient for quick\ncapture sessions.\n\nWe will use both throughout the tutorial.  Whichever you choose, start it up and\nleave it running.\n\n#2 Proxy Our Connection\nLet's set up our internet connection to use this proxy. On macOS, Under Setting\n-> Network, select your network and click advanced.\n\nSetting -> Network on macOSUnder proxies, enable both HTTP and HTTPS proxies and\nchoose port 8080:\n\nSetup Proxy under Setting -> Network-> Advanced on macOSOn Windows, follow these steps\n[https://www.howtogeek.com/tips/how-to-set-your-proxy-settings-in-windows-8.1/] \nto set up a proxy.\n\nOn Linux, MITM supports a transparent proxying\n[https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/howto-transparent/] at the network layer.\n\nAdding mitmproxy as a Certificate Authority\nWe now have our connection proxied to go through our instance of mitmproxy.\n However, if we attempt to make an HTTPS-based request in a web browser (loading\ntwitter.com for example), something interesting happens.\n\nChrome does not recognize the certificateChrome is warning us that we might be\nsubject to a man in the middle attack.\n\nWhat Is a Man in the Middle\nA man in the middle attack (MITM) is a security threat where an attacker can\nintercept incoming and outgoing requests.  You think you are talking to\nTwitter.com, but you are talking to the man in the middle, who is talking to\nTwitter for you.  This MITM can view everything you send and even change what\nyou receive.\n\nThe HTTPS protocol prevents MITM attacks.  The HTTPS protocol is pretty complex,\nbut all we need to know is that HTTPS uses a trusted Certificate Authority (CA)\nto sign a certificate. Our browsers assume that if a trusted CA signs the\ncertificate, we are talking directly to who we think we are.\n\nYou can view what CA signed the certificate of the website you are viewing in\nyour browser.\n\nViewing a certificate in your browserThis is great for protecting online\ncommunication but problematic for our debugging purposes.

For this reason, don't share your MITM private key, or\nany private key, with others.\n\nAdd the Certificate on MacOS\nOn macOS, the easiest way to add a new CA is to copy it to the desktop and then\ndouble-click it.\n\ncp ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer ~/Desktop\n\n\nYou will be prompted for your credentials, and the certificate will be added as\n'untrusted'.\n\nDouble-click on the certificate in the Keychain list and set the 'Secure Sockets\nLayer' drop down to 'Always Trust':\n\nYou will then be prompted for your password again, and then your certificate\nwill be trusted:\n\nInstalling the Trusted Root Certificate on Windows\nIf you are on Windows, follow this guide to add the MITM root certificate as a\ntrusted root certificate authority\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/skype-sdk/sdn/articles/installing-the-trusted-root-certificate]\n.\n\nInstalling the Certificate on Debian Based Linux Distributions\nOn Debian-based Linux distributions, follow these steps:\n\n> mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra\n> cp ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra/mitmproxy-ca-cert.crt\n> update-ca-certificates\n\n\nWe will be using these steps later when we work with docker containers on macOS\nand Windows.\n\nGreat Success!\nAt this point, assuming you still have mitmproxy running and you still have your\nnetwork interface setup to proxy through localhost:8080, you should be able to\nview all the HTTP and HTTPS network requests your machine is making in the\nmitmproxy (or MITMWeb) window.\n\nHere is Slack making requests:\n\nmitmweb has captured a request from the slack applicationAll HTTPS connections\nnow have certificates signed by mitmproxy, which your machine trusts.\n\nGoogle.com now shows a mitmproxy signed certificateMITM the Docker Linux\nContainer Host on macOS & Windows\nDocker containers run differently on macOS and WindowsAt this point,  we can\nsuccessfully capture traffic on our host operating system. Unfortunately, this\nis insufficient for capturing docker container traffic on macOS and Windows. So\nlet's move on to proxying traffic on the Linux Container Host.\n\nOn macOS and Windows, Linux containers do not run on the host OS. They can't\nbecause they need a Linux host to run.  Instead, they run on the Linux Container\nHost, a VM that Docker Desktop manages.\n\nTo see the docker daemon's incoming and outgoing requests, we need to get our\nproxy settings and our certificate authority into that VM.\n\n> Before we proceed, we need to clear the proxy settings on the host network\nconnection. We can leave mitmproxy (or MITMWeb running).\nOn Windows and macOS, the easiest way to configure a proxy is via Docker\nDesktop. Configure the proxy settings under Preferences -> Resources -> Proxies.\n\nConfigure the proxy settings under Preferences -> Resources -> Proxies.With that\ndone, the network interface will be proxied.  All that is left to do is get our\ncertificate trusted by the Linux container host. Thankfully, Docker Desktop\ntakes care of this for us.  On startup, Docker Desktop loads the trusted root\ncertificates from the host machine into the Docker VM, so all we need to do is\nrestart docker. (Restart Docker in Docker Desktop).\n\nDocker MITM on Linux\nOn Linux, we can add a proxy by editing the docker client config and then\nrestarting.\n\n> cat ~/.docker/config.json\n{\n \"proxies\":\n {\n   \"default\":\n   {\n     \"httpProxy\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8080\",\n     \"httpsProxy\": \"http://127.0.0.1:8080\"\n   }\n }\n}\n\n\n> sudo service docker restart\n\n\n\nTest it\nAfter restarting, we can test the proxying by performing a docker pull for a\nrandom image\n\n➜  ~ docker pull couchbase:7.0.0-beta\n7.0.0-beta: Pulling from library/couchbase\n83ee3a23efb7: Pull complete\ndb98fc6f11f0: Pull complete\nf611acd52c6c: Pull complete\n3aa2029a80db: Pull complete\nabe30feace46: Pull complete\n9b70018fbd54: Pull complete\nd9b67d157052: Pull complete\n212afe5e3a9c: Pull complete\nff5e5d4b4f9c: Pull complete\n4df60b92878a: Pull complete\neee5137af1d8: Pull complete\nc4ef83141448: Pull complete\n6a04071b6d8c: Pull complete\nf52d17d818b3: Pull complete\nDigest: sha256:290a7a0623b62e02438e6f0cd03adf116ac465f70fc4254a4059bcf51e8fa040\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for couchbase:7.0.0-beta\ndocker.io/library/couchbase:7.0.0-beta\n\n\nWe can then see the requests and responses in our proxy:\n\nWe can even see the binary payload of the layer requests and the fact that\ndocker uses Cloudflare as a CDN.\n\nTroubleshooting\nIf docker pull fails with a certificate error or the requests don't get proxied,\nmake sure you have restarted docker at least once and that the proxy settings\nare in place.\n\nCapturing Docker Container Traffic\nWe now know how to capture traffic on our host machine and the Linux container\nhost. But what happens when we make requests from inside a running container?\n\n> docker run -it ubuntu\nroot@ca43de1bb8b1:/# apt upgrade & apt update & apt install curl\n...\nroot@167f5742c295:/# curl http://google.com\n<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\">\n<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\n<H1>301 Moved</H1>\nThe document has moved\n<A HREF=\"http://www.google.com/\">here</A>.\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n\nWe are successfully capturing the requests and responses:\n\nmitmwebHowever, we hit problems when we try to use HTTPS:\n\nroot@ca43de1bb8b1:/# curl https://google.com/\ncurl: (60) server certificate verification failed. CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt CRLfile: none\nMore details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\n\ncurl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a \"bundle\"\n of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default\n bundle file isn't adequate, you can specify an alternate file\n using the --cacert option.\nIf this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in\n the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a\n problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might\n not match the domain name in the URL).\nIf you'd like to turn off curl's verification of the certificate, use\n the -k (or --insecure) option.\n > exit\n\n\nAdding the CA Cert to our Linux Container\nThe solution here is a familiar one.  We need to follow the steps we used above\nfor configuring Linux to trust a certificate authority, but we need to do it\ninside our container.\n\nThere are several ways to accomplish this.\n\nSolution #1: Volume Mount The Cert\nThe simplest solution is to mount the certificate into the proper spot in our\ncontainer and run update-ca-certificates.\n\nAlpine:\n# Run container and mount in our CA Cert\n> docker run -it -v ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer alpine\n# Add ca-certificates (and curl for testing)\nroot@167f5742c295:/# apk update && apk upgrade && apk add ca-certificates && apk add curl\n...\n\n# include trust our cert\nroot@167f5742c295:/# update-ca-certificates\nUpdating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\ndone.\n\n# Test https\nroot@167f5742c295:/# curl https://google.com\n<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\">\n<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\n<H1>301 Moved</H1>\nThe document has moved\n<A HREF=\"https://www.google.com/\">here</A>.\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n# Success!\n\n\nUbuntu\nThe general pattern with some small modifications works on Ubuntu-based images\nas well.\n\n> docker run -it -v ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.cer:/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mitmproxy-ca-cert.crt ubuntu\n\nroot@167f5742c295:/# apt update && apt upgrade && apt install ca-certificates curl\n\nroot@167f5742c295:/# update-ca-certificates \nUpdating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...\n1 added, 0 removed; done.\nRunning hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...\ndone.\n\nroot@167f5742c295:/# curl https://google.com\n<HTML><HEAD><meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text/html;charset=utf-8\">\n<TITLE>301 Moved</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>\n<H1>301 Moved</H1>\nThe document has moved\n<A HREF=\"https://www.google.com/\">here</A>.\n</BODY></HTML>\n\n\\> # Success!!\n\n\nSolution #2: Extend the Image\nVolume mounting the certificate and manually running update-ca-certificates is\nan excellent proof of concept, but if you want to run a docker container in the\nbackground and have all traffic proxied, then interactive mode won't cut it. In\nthat case, extending the image is the way to go.\n\nExtending an Alpine Image to Add a Certificate Authority\nWe can create a new Dockerfile that extends the image we want to proxy and add\nin the needed certificate.\n\nFROM alpine # or any alpine based image\nRUN apk update && apk add curl\nWORKDIR /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\nCOPY mitmproxy.crt mitmproxy.crt\nRUN update-ca-certificates\n\n\nWe can then build it and tag it with a :mitm tag.\n\n> docker build --tag alpine:mitm .\n[+] Building 1.9s (10/10) FINISHED                             \n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 200B                      0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/alpin  0.0s\n => CACHED [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/alpine            0.0s\n => [internal] load build context                         0.2s\n => => transferring context: 1.36kB                       0.2s\n => [2/5] RUN apk update && apk add curl                  1.4s\n => [3/5] WORKDIR /usr/local/share/ca-certificates        0.0s\n => [4/5] COPY mitmproxy.crt mitmproxy.crt                0.0s \n => [5/5] RUN /usr/sbin/update-ca-certificates            0.3s \n => exporting to image                                    0.1s \n => => exporting layers                                   0.1s \n => => writing image sha256:ca5be16f3d19c34ea5e29ac1774b  0.0s \n => => naming to docker.io/library/alpine:mitm            0.0s\n\n\nNow anytime we run this image, it will be ready to accept responses signed by\nour certificate authority.

We can now capture HTTPS traffic made by any containers we run.\nCombined with the previous steps, we can now intercept and inspect HTTP and\nHTTPS protocol traffic on our host machine, on a Linux virtual machine running\nin a hypervisor, and in the actual running containers.\n\nIf you can get something running on your local machine, you can now capture and\ninspect its network requests.

In order to build a project that continues to evolve, to grow, to have strong community support, and to continue to offer most of the value for free, we need a sustainable business model. We are taking steps to prevent anyone from taking advantage of Earthly in a way that could jeopardize our business model. We believe that this changes nothing for the overwhelming majority of the Earthly user-base.\\n\\n## What is BSL?\\n\\n[Business Source License](https://mariadb.com/bsl11/) is a [source-available license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-available_software) created by MariaDB to \\\"strike a balance between being able to run a financially viable software company while still supporting the original tenets of Open Source, such as empowering all software developers to be part of the innovation cycle\\\". Under BSL, the code is not open-source in the spirit of [The Open Source Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition), however, the code is available for free immediately and it becomes open-source after a set period of time. In Earthly's case, the code automatically becomes open-source, under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, after three years.\\n\\nOur intention is for the code to continue to be provided in the spirit of the pure open-source definition, with one key difference: you cannot create a commercial offering (like a CI) based on Earthly.\\n\\n## What does this mean for me?\\n\\nUnless you are intending to take the Earthly source code, turn it into a competing CI or a build-service product, which you sell as a service, then this change will not impact you in any way.\\n\\nYou can continue to use Earthly like you always have. You may build unrelated commercial products that are built with Earthly. And you may even build in-house build services or CIs, as long as those are not offered commercially to third parties. However, you cannot build a commercial Earthly offering.\\n\\n## What is Earthly's business model?\\n\\nOur business model will be based on the [open-core model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-core_model). An open-core model means that some amount of additional functionality is built around an open code-base. The core is free and the source is made available, while the additional functionality around the core is paid-for. Usually, the additional functionality is either targeted at large teams or enterprises, and/or is based on a managed service offering. Examples of open-core business models are [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) ([Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/)), [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/) ([DataStax](https://www.datastax.com/)), the [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) ([Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/)), [Redis](https://redis.io/) ([Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/)), [CockroachDB](https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach) ([Cockroach Labs](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/)) and many others.\\n\\nWe believe that this model has been battle-tested and is becoming the norm in the world of open developer tooling and cloud infrastructure.\\n\\n## Why is a license change needed?\\n\\n![\\\"We believe in a model where both the creator and the society can win.\\\"](/content/images/2021/01/Styled-quote--3-.png)\\n\\nWe live in a world where the power of supporting innovation is concentrated within a handful of companies. These companies have many orders of magnitude more resources than the average entrepreneur, and have the upper hand when it comes to delivering new technology to large audiences.\\n\\nHowever, innovative ideas come from everywhere - not just the giants. Not having the same resources as a large company means that many great ideas do not turn into products, especially for startups. Some tech giants abuse their power and tip the scales in their favor, which means that we, as a society, are losing by missing out on innovation.\\n\\nWe believe in a model where both the creator and the society can win.\\n\\nUsers of developer tools and cloud infrastructure have made their voices heard and they prefer free and open software. Non-free developer tools tend to be the exception rather than the norm. The bar has been set, and we as an industry have agreed that this approach reduces the risk of vendor lock-in and enables integration that will last for a long time. Tool authors have thus adapted, and more often than not the tool comes with the source code too. The investors who back these authors are also embracing this model.\\n\\nHowever, certain large technology companies have abused the freedom of open-source and have launched competing products offered as-a-service based on the very same code base. These competing services come supercharged with a strong platform play and seemingly infinite technical resources to pull off the effort. They are not necessarily better products, but a large company can make the offering better known through its influence. This kind of offering starves the original authors of their resources: revenue and investors. Innovation will grind to a halt as a result.\\n\\nWithout stable revenue and an exciting-enough story to tell Wall Street, such creators are doomed to never reach their full potential. The talent that created the innovation in the first place can no longer be sustained. When the creators are losing, the community is losing, because they end up getting sub-par support from third-parties. Such companies end up being acquired for a modest sum by yet another tech giant, a transaction that may or may not hinder their growth.

It's called BuildKit, and it is what turns a Dockerfile into a\nDocker image.  And it doesn't just build Docker images; it can build OCI images\nand several other output formats. OpenFasS [https://www.openfaas.com/] uses it\nto turn functions into full containers, and here at Earthly, we use it to create\ncomplete continuous integration pipelines.\n\nYou may not know you've used BuildKit because other applications wrap it.\n Modern versions of docker build can use BuildKit and it will soon be enabled by\ndefault.  Today let's look at how to use BuildKit directly.\n\nHistory\n> BuildKit is a new project under the Moby umbrella for building and packaging\nsoftware using containers. It's a new codebase meant to replace the internals of\nthe current build features in the Moby Engine. - Introducing BuildKit\n[https://blog.mobyproject.org/introducing-buildkit-17e056cc5317]\nTõnis Tiigi,  a Docker employee and BuildKit's primary developer, created\nBuildKit to separate the logic of building images from the main moby project and\nto enable future development. BuildKit has support for pluggable frontends,\nwhich allow it to make more than just docker images using Dockerfiles. With\nBuildKit, we can substitute the Dockerfile syntax for hlb\n[https://github.com/openllb/hlb] and replace the docker image format for a pure\ntar file output. That is just one of the possible combinations BuildKit, with\nits pluggable backends and frontends, unlocks.\n\nThe original BuildKit proposal is found in the moby project:\n\n> \"Buildkit is a proposal to separate out docker build experience into a separate\nproject, allowing different users to collaborate on the underlying technology\nand reuse and customize it in different ways.\"\n> \"One of the main design goals of BuildKit is to separate frontend and backend\nconcerns during a build process\" - Intial BuildKit Proposal\n[https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/32925]\nInstall BuildKit\nbuildctl\nBuildKit has two primary components: buildctl and buildkitd.  buildctl is the\nBuildKit controller, and it communicates with buildkitd. Though designed for\nLinux, it can run on macOS and Windows under WSL2.\n\nOn macOS, you can install buildctl with brew.\n\nbrew install buildkit\n\n\nOn Linux and Windows, grab a release from Github\n[https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases].\n\nAfterward, you should be able to call buildctl\n\n➜  ~ buildctl\nNAME:\n   buildctl - build utility\n\nUSAGE:\n   buildctl [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]\n\nVERSION:\n   0.8.1\n\nCOMMANDS:\n   du        disk usage\n   prune     clean up build cache\n   build, b  build\n   debug     debug utilities\n   help, h   Shows a list of commands or help for one command\n\nGLOBAL OPTIONS:\n   --debug                enable debug output in logs\n   --addr value           buildkitd address (default: \"unix:///run/buildkit/buildkitd.sock\")\n   --tlsservername value  buildkitd server name for certificate validation\n   --tlscacert value      CA certificate for validation\n   --tlscert value        client certificate\n   --tlskey value         client key\n   --tlsdir value         directory containing CA certificate, client certificate, and client key\n   --timeout value        timeout backend connection after value seconds (default: 5)\n   --help, -h             show help\n   --version, -v          print the version\n\n\nOther Tools: In this guide, we will use pstree\n[https://linux.die.net/man/1/pstree], br [https://github.com/Canop/broot], and \nmitmproxy. They are not required to use BuildKit or to follow this guide, but\nthey help us demonstrate how BuildKit works.\n\nbuildkitd\nbuildkitd does the actual work of transforming a build definition into some\noutput. It is designed to be a long-running process. It also isn't possible to\nrun it on macOS or Windows.  For this tutorial, we will run it as a docker\ncontainer. That will work regardless of your host OS.\n\n➜ docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit\nUnable to find image 'moby/buildkit:latest' locally\nlatest: Pulling from moby/buildkit\n05e7bc50f07f: Already exists \nd7d1da19a5ee: Already exists \n10f8f68c5adb: Already exists \n00d21c774e02: Already exists \nDigest: sha256:ecd5ad4910c322cad6995f8a1a0805d9da4b09ed4aaef40627f5bcb8ebf74068\nStatus: Downloaded newer image for moby/buildkit:latest\n6c4342639e07eedc16ba2f5d9f91fb2f82e1793cdea73aec1725e6652cab315a\n\n➜ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND       CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES\n6c4342639e07   moby/buildkit \"buildkitd\" 45 seconds ago   Up 43 seconds             buildkit\n\n\nWe also need to tell buildctl where to find buildkitd:\n\nexport BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit\n\n\nOn Linux, you can substitute these steps with just running buildkitd to avoid\nthe container.\n\nBuilding an Image\nNow that we have all dependencies we need, let's build an image using BuildKit:\n\ncat .\\DockerFile\nFROM alpine\nRUN echo \"built with BuildKit!\" >  file\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\"]\n\n\n➜buildctl build \\\n    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \\\n    --local context=. \\\n    --local dockerfile=.\n[+] Building 1.4s (5/5) FINISHED                               \n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 453B                      0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/alpin  1.3s\n => [auth] library/alpine:pull token for registry-1.dock  0.0s\n => [1/2] FROM docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n => => resolve docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n  => [2/2] RUN echo \"built with buildkit!\" >  file   \n\n\nWe have built the image, but we haven't given it a name nor told BuildKit what\nto do with it.\n\nBy default, the build result will remain internal to BuildKit. An output type\nneeds to be specified to retrieve the result. Let's specify a docker hub account\nthat we have permission to push to:\n\n➜ buildctl build \\\n    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \\\n    --local context=. \\\n    --local dockerfile=. \\\n    --output type=image,name=docker.io/agbell/test,push=true\n[+] Building 2.9s (8/8) FINISHED                               \n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 32B                       0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/alpin  0.7s\n => [auth] library/alpine:pull token for registry-1.dock  0.0s\n => [1/1] FROM docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n => => resolve docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n => [2/2] RUN echo \"built with buildkit!\" >  file \n => exporting to image                                    2.2s\n => => exporting layers                                   0.0s\n => => exporting manifest sha256:a81d7671b5ceeb534739c95  0.0s\n => => exporting config sha256:4c8c89bca725572cf9ff3bd6a  0.0s\n\n\nAfter that, we can pull it and run it:\n\n➜ docker run -it agbell/test\n/ # cat file\nbuilt with BuildKit!\n\n\nTangent: Where are `FROM's from\nIf we have an image locally on our machine, can we use it in a FROM to build\nsomething based on it? Let's find out by altering our FROM to use a local image:\n\nFROM agbell/test:local\nRUN echo \"BuildKit built\">  file\nCMD [\"/bin/sh\"] \n\n\n\n> docker tag alpine agbell/test:local\n> buildctl build \\\n    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \\\n    --local context=. \\\n    --local dockerfile=. \\\n------\n > [internal] load metadata for docker.io/agbell/test:local:\n------\nerror: failed to solve: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = failed to solve with frontend dockerfile.v0: failed to create LLB definition: docker.io/agbell/test:local: not found\n\n\n\nIt doesn't work. It looks like it is trying to fetch the image from docker.io,\nthe default docker hub registry.\n\nWe can verify this by quickly capturing requests from buildkitd:\n\n➜ cat ~\\Dockerfile\nFROM moby/buildkit \nRUN apk update && apk add curl\nWORKDIR /usr/local/share/ca-certificates\nCOPY mitmproxy.crt mitmproxy.crt\nRUN update-ca-certificates\n➜ docker build . -t buildkit:mitm\n ...\n➜ docker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit buildkit:mitm\n6676dc0109eb3f5f09f7380d697005b6aae401bb72a4ee366f0bb279c0be137b\n\n\nWe can see a 404, and this confirms buildkitd is expecting registry that it can\naccess over the network using the docker registry v2 api.\n\nWatching It Build\nBuildkitd is responsible for building the image, but runc does the actual\nexecution of each step. runc executes each RUN command in your dockerfile in a\nseparate process.  runc requires Linux kernel 5.2  or later with support for\ncgroups, and is why buildkitd can't run natively on macOS or Windows.\n\nWhat is runc\n> \"Please note that runc is a low-level tool not designed with an end-user in\nmind. It is mostly employed by other higher-level container software. Therefore,\nunless there is some specific use case that prevents the use of tools like\nDocker or Podman, it is not recommended to use runc directly.\" - runc readme\n[https://github.com/opencontainers/runc]\nWe can watch the execution of our build by using pstree and watch. Open two side\nby side terminals, run docker exec -it buildkit \"/bin/watch\" \"-n1\" \"pstree -p\" \nin one and call buildctl build ... in the other. You will see buildkitd start a \nbuildkit-runc process and then a separate process for each RUN command.\n\nHow to see Docker Processes on macOS and Windows\nOn macOS and Windows, Docker processes run on a separate virtual machine (VM).\nIf you're using the default and recommended Docker Desktop, this VM is the Linux\ncontainer host.\n\nNote: Docker Machine is an earlier approach to running Docker on macOS and\nWindows where the Docker VM runs in VirtualBox or VMware. Docker Machine steps\nmay differ.\n\nThe above exec trick lets us see the processes inside a specific container, but\nto see all the processes running across all the containers, we need a different\ntechnique. To do that, we can use docker run and nsenter:\n\ndocker run -it --rm --privileged --pid=host ubuntu nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i s\n\n\nWe can now use watch and pstree to view the whole container host in a single\nview:\n\ndocker-desktop:/# pstree -p\ninit(1)-+-containerd(983)\n        |-containerd-shim(1018)---acpid(1039)\n        |-containerd-shim(1064)---diagnosticsd(1085)---sh(1354)\n        |-containerd-shim(1109)-+-containerd-shim(2495)-+-buildkitd(2522)\n        |                       |                       `-sh(2614)---watch(2903)\n        |                       |-containerd-shim(4035)---sh(4062)---pstree(5058)\n        |                       |-docker-init(1136)---entrypoint.sh(1154)---logwrite(1183)---lifecycle-serve(1188)-+-logwrite(1340)---containerd(1345)\n        |                       |                                                                                  |-logwrite(1550)---dockerd(1555)\n        |                       |                                                                                  `-logwrite(1800)\n        |                       |-rpc.statd(1293)\n        |                       `-rpcbind(1265)\n        |-containerd-shim(1162)---host-timesync-d(1199)\n        |-containerd-shim(1245)---kmsg(1282)\n        |-containerd-shim(1310)---start(1347)---sntpc(1397)\n        |-containerd-shim(1374)\n        |-containerd-shim(1433)---trim-after-dele(1460)\n        |-containerd-shim(1483)---vpnkit-forwarde(1517)\n        |-memlogd(442)\n        |-rungetty.sh(429)---login(431)---sh(443)\n        |-rungetty.sh(432)---login(433)---sh(437)\n        `-vpnkit-bridge(452)\n\n\nWe can use pstree with a process id (pid) while a build is running to focus on\njust the buildkitd tree:\n\ndocker-desktop:/# watch -n 1 pstree -p 2522 \n\n\nBuildKit Output Types\nSo far, we have only used output type=image, but BuildKit supports several types\nof outputs.\n\nWe can output a tar:\n\nbuildctl build \\\n    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 \\\n    --local context=. \\\n    --local dockerfile=. \\\n    --output type=tar,dest=out.tar\n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 31B                       0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n...\n => exporting to client                                   2.6s\n => => sending tarball                                    2.6s\n\n\n> ls *.tar\n out.tar\n\n\nAnd if we try to load it as a docker image, it will fail:\n\n> docker load < out.tar\nopen /var/lib/docker/tmp/docker-import-013443725/bin/json: no such file or directory\n\n\nThis tag isn't an image of any sort. There are no layers or manifests, just the\nfull filesystem that the built image would contain.\n\nWe can also export directly to the local filesystem:\n\nbuildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=local,dest=output   \n[+] Building 2.6s (10/10) FINISHED                             \n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 31B                       0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n => [internal] load metadata for docker.io/library/alpin  0.6s\n => [auth] library/alpine:pull token for registry-1.dock  0.0s\n => [1/5] FROM docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n => => resolve docker.io/library/alpine@sha256:08d6ca16c  0.0s\n => CACHED [2/5] RUN apk update                           0.0s\n => CACHED [3/5] RUN apk upgrade                          0.0s\n => CACHED [4/5] RUN apk add gcc                          0.0s\n => CACHED [5/5] RUN sleep 1                              0.0s\n => exporting to client                                   1.9s\n => => copying files 121.14MB                             1.9sr\n\n\nThis filesystem output could be useful if we were trying to trim our image down.\n We could look through the output and find things to remove and use a\nmulti-stage build to remove them. broot [https://github.com/Canop/broot] is\npretty handy for this:\n\nWhat is in FROM scratch\nOne thing we can do with our newfound powers is investigate the scratch keyword.\n The scratch keyword doesn't correspond to an actual image. We can't run it:\n\ndocker run scratch\nUnable to find image' scratch:latest' locally\ndocker: Error response from daemon: 'scratch' is a reserved name.\n\n\nHowever, does it actually contain anything?  Is a FROM scratch image literally\nempty or are there certain required elements of unix filesystem that scratch \nprovides?  Let's find out:\n\n> mkdir scratch\n> cat .\\Dockerfile\nFROM scratch\n> buildctl build --frontend dockerfile.v0 --local context=. --local dockerfile=. --output type=local,dest=scratch\n[+] Building 0.1s (3/3) FINISHED                               \n => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile      0.0s\n => => transferring dockerfile: 31B                       0.0s\n => [internal] load .dockerignore                         0.0s\n => => transferring context: 2B                           0.0s\n => exporting to client                                   0.0s\n => => copying files                                      0.0s\n > ls scratch\n > br -s scratch\n 0 ./output\n\n\nIt's empty! The scratch keyword indicates a completely empty docker layer. The\nmore you know! (The more you know is a trademark of The National Broadcasting\nCompany, who in no way endorse this article 😀 )\n\nConclusion\nAlright, we have now covered some ways to use BuildKit directly.  BuildKit is\nused internally by docker build in modern docker versions, but using it directly\nunlocks some extra options.\n\nOne use we covered was changing the output type. We can use BuildKit to export\ntars and local file systems. We also use pstree and mitmProxy to watch how\nbuildkitd forks processes and make network requests.\n\nThere is much more to learn, though. BuildKit is behind the docker buildx \nmultiplatform build feature and supports the ability to have multiple workers\nexecute builds in parallel. BuildKit also supports caching, different frontends,\ndocker-compose builds, faster multi-stage builds, and several other features.\n\nIn a future article, we will cover creating a custom frontend and leaving the\nDockerfile syntax behind.","feature_image":"/content/images/2021/02/top1.png","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2021-02-08T16:21:42.000Z","updated_at":"2021-02-24T20:18:12.000Z","published_at":"2021-02-19T14:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":"And how do you use it?","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"6024042b63d16e00453258bd","uuid":"7229a18b-6db0-4b6f-baa5-492ef3acd438","title":"INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages","slug":"intercal-yaml-and-other-horrible-programming-languages","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"## PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS\\n\\nIn 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called *sparks*, and double quotes are called *rabbit ears*, less than (<) is an *angle*, and a dash (-) is a *worm*.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:\\n\\n> One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - [INTERCAL Manual](http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm).\\n\\nThe compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include `VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE` for accessing an array incorrectly, `IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE` for invalid control flow, `PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS` for threading issues, `I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM` for file not found, and [many many more](http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors).\\n\\nYes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.\\n\\nThe language itself looks less fun.  Here is [Hello World](http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal):\\n```\\n       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL\\n       PLEASE ,1 <- #5\\n       DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #54\\n       DO ,1 SUB #2 <- #192\\n       DO ,1 SUB #3 <- #136\\n       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 <- #208\\n       DO ,1 SUB #5 <- #98\\n       DO COME FROM (1)\\n       DO READ OUT ,1\\n(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 <- #134\\n(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)\\n```\\n\\nOne of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the `COMEFROM` [instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples), seen here in a variant of BASIC.[^0]  \\n\\n```\\n10 COMEFROM 40\\n20 INPUT \\\"WHAT IS YOUR NAME? \\\"; A$\\n30 PRINT \\\"HELLO, \\\"; A$\\n40 REM\\n```\\n\\n A `COMEFROM` anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many `COMEFROM`'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.  \\n \\n A `COMEFROM` is the inverse of a `GOTO` statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and `COMEFROM` attempts to break that model.\\n\\n## VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE\\nAt Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?  \\n\\nJava came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.[^1]\\n\\nYAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:\\n```\\ntitle: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages\\nauthor: Adam\\n```\\n\\nNothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter. \\n\\nI suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language. \\n\\nI'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml)'s build script: \\n\\n\\n```\\nlanguage: shell\\nos: linux\\n\\nservices:\\n  - docker\\n```\\nThat seems like straight-forward config. \\n\\n```\\njobs:\\n  include:\\n    - stage: Build\\n      env: BUILD=linux\\n      workspaces:\\n        create:\\n          name: ws-linux\\n          paths: deploy\\n```\\n`create`, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.  \\n```\\n      script:\\n        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true\\n        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5\\n        - ls -la deploy\\n        - ./.github_deploy\\n```\\nNow the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.\\n```        \\n      if: type = push\\n      script:\\n        - source ./.multi_arch_docker\\n        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x\\n```\\nThere we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file! \\n\\nThat was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:\\n```\\n- hosts: all\\n  tasks:\\n    - include: foo.yml\\n      when: something == \\\"foo\\\"\\n    \\n    - include: bar.yml\\n      when: something == \\\"bar\\\"\\n```\\n\\nHere is GitHub Actions:\\n```\\nsteps:\\n - name: Step 7\\n   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}\\n   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.\\n```\\nHere is part of a Grafana [Helm Chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml): \\n```\\n\\n{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type \\\"pvc\\\")) }}\\napiVersion: apps/v1\\nkind: Deployment\\nmetadata:\\n  name: {{ template \\\"grafana.fullname\\\" . }}\\n  namespace: {{ template \\\"grafana.namespace\\\" . }}\\n  labels:\\n    {{- include \\\"grafana.labels\\\" . | nindent 4 }}\\n{{- if .Values.labels }}\\n{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}\\n{{- end }}\\n{{- with .Values.annotations }}\\n  annotations:\\n{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}\\n{{- end }}\\n```\\n\\n I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw.

Let's\ncontinue.\n\n      script:\n        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true\n        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5\n        - ls -la deploy\n        - ./.github_deploy\n\n\nNow the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of\ncommands. We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.\n\n      if: type = push\n      script:\n        - source ./.multi_arch_docker\n        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x\n\n\nThere we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!\n\nThat was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific. Here is a simple\nexample from Ansible:\n\n- hosts: all\n  tasks:\n    - include: foo.yml\n      when: something == \"foo\"\n    \n    - include: bar.yml\n      when: something == \"bar\"\n\n\nHere is GitHub Actions:\n\nsteps:\n - name: Step 7\n   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}\n   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.\n\n\nHere is part of a Grafana Helm Chart\n[https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml]\n:\n\n\n{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type \"pvc\")) }}\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: {{ template \"grafana.fullname\" . }}\n  namespace: {{ template \"grafana.namespace\" . }}\n  labels:\n    {{- include \"grafana.labels\" . | nindent 4 }}\n{{- if .Values.labels }}\n{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}\n{{- end }}\n{{- with .Values.annotations }}\n  annotations:\n{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}\n{{- end }}\n\n\nI think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like\nhammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job[3].\n\nHow did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML?\nIs calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program\njust config you give to gcc?\n\nDid things ever get this complicated in XML times?\n\nIt turns out they did:\n\n<xsl:stylesheet version=\"1.0\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\">\n  <xsl:output method=\"text\" omit-xml-declaration=\"yes\" />\n\n  <xsl:template match=\"/\">\n    <xsl:call-template name=\"FizzBuzz\">\n      <xsl:with-param name=\"i\" select=\"1\" />\n    </xsl:call-template>\n  </xsl:template>\n\n  <xsl:template name=\"FizzBuzz\">\n    <xsl:param name=\"i\" />\n    <xsl:choose>\n      <xsl:when test=\"($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0\">FizzBuzz&#xa;</xsl:when>\n      <xsl:when test=\"$i mod 3 = 0\">Fizz&#xa;</xsl:when>\n      <xsl:when test=\"$i mod 5 = 0\">Buzz&#xa;</xsl:when>\n      <xsl:otherwise><xsl:value-of select=\"$i\" /><xsl:text>&#xa;</xsl:text></xsl:otherwise>\n    </xsl:choose>\n    <xsl:if test=\"$i &lt; 100\">\n      <xsl:call-template name=\"FizzBuzz\">\n        <xsl:with-param name=\"i\" select=\"$i + 1\" />\n      </xsl:call-template>\n    </xsl:if>\n  </xsl:template>\n</xsl:stylesheet>\n\n\nThat is FizzBuzz in XSLT\n[https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8]. I\nassume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an\nad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized\nthing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.\n\nIt burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a\nprogramming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.\n\nThe problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off\nimplementations. TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage,\nand features. You can't use Travis's concat function or conditional regex in the\nYAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.\n\nIn a vague way, this YAML problem is like the COMEFROM problem. If you know\nyaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line. You\nneed to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific\nsystem it's for. And that is hard.\n\nI HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM\nThe line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright\ndividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language\nconstructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified\nprogramming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.\n\nThat is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this\narea.\n\nI like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better\nthan YAML? Anything else! Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke\nprogramming language be?\n\n(100)  PLEASE NOTE THIS IS THE FIZZBUZZ FUNCTION\t\n\n\tPLEASE NOTE: IS THE INPUT DIVISIBLE BY #15?\n\tDO .1 <- .100\t\n\tDO .2 <- #15\n\tDO (2030) NEXT\n\tPLEASE NOTE: is .4 (remainder) == 0?\n\tDO .4 <- '?\"'.4~.4'~#1\"$#1'~#3\n\tDO (130) NEXT\n\t\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS NOT DIVISIBLE BY #15 => CHECK IF DIVISIBLE BY #3\n\tDO .2 <- #3\n\tDO (2030) NEXT\n\tPLEASE NOTE: is .4 (remainder) == 0?\n\tDO .4 <- '?\"'.4~.4'~#1\"$#1'~#3\n\tDO (110) NEXT\n\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS NOT DIVISIBLE BY #3 => CHECK IF DIVISIBLE BY #5\n\tDO .2 <- #5\n\tDO (2030) NEXT\n\tPLEASE NOTE: is .4 (remainder) == 0?\n\tDO .4 <- '?\"'.4~.4'~#1\"$#1'~#3\n\tDO (120) NEXT\n\t\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS REGULAR => RETURN THE INPUT\n\tDO .101 <- .100\n\tDO (199) NEXT\n\n(110)\tDO (111) NEXT\n\tDO FORGET #1\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS DIVISIBLE BY #3 => RETURN FIZZ\n\tDO .101 <- #61440\n\tDO (199) NEXT\n\n\n(120)\tDO (111) NEXT\n\tDO FORGET #1\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS DIVISIBLE BY #5 => RETURN BUZZ\n\tDO .101 <- #45056\n\tDO (199) NEXT\n\n(130)\tDO (111) NEXT\n\tDO FORGET #1\n\tPLEASE NOTE NUMBER IS DIVISIBLE BY #15 => RETURN FIZZ-BUZZ\n\tDO .101 <- #64256\n\tDO (199) NEXT\n\n(111)\tDO RESUME .4\n\t\n(199)\tDO FORGET #1\n\tDO RESUME #1\n\n\nOh God.\n\nWell, ok, maybe not INTERCAL but anything else.

Just a simple `./ngrok http 3000`, and your tunnel is up and running! It also comes with an inspector for all traffic traveling over its tunnels. Pretty slick right? However, for a stable domain it costs _at least_ $5/month, and it only goes up from there. Additionally, you're limited in the number of connections and tunnels that you can make.\\n\\nHowever, it can be hard to trust fancy tools like `ngrok` until you experience how the sausage is made; at least once. It may also be hard to explan yet _another_ recurring charge on the credit card to your partner. So, here is a tutorial to build yourself a DIY `ngrok` for free (at least 12 months, after that its very cheap), using the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/), [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/), and (of course) [Earthly](https://earthly.dev/). The result is a decent approximation that won't break the bank.\\n\\n## So, How Does `ngrok` Work?\\n\\nTo understand why `ngrok` is so cool, you'll need to first understand how you would normally get traffic from the broader internet into your local machine. A typical flow would be something like this:\\n\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2021/02/without_ngrok-2.png\",\"width\":1664,\"height\":413,\"cardWidth\":\"wide\",\"alt\":\"Diagram showing the flow of traffic from a users web browser, through the internet, a home router, and finally the users computer. It points out that the user controls the DNS lookup, router, and their machine.\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"This flow is normal for most of the machines on the internet today, but it has its downsides for local development. For instance, most home and non-commerical internet connections do not have a [Static IP](https://whatismyipaddress.com/dynamic-static) - which means you need to double-check your IP address before sending it out, or (more often) install and configure additional software to keep your DNS records up to date.\\n\\nAdditionally, you'll need to configure your router to forward that traffic to your machine. This configuration is typically fairly annoying to set up, and should also be turned off each time you arent using it, otherwise you are keeping your computer exposed to the internet at large! Its like putting a giant welcome mat out for hackers during their automated scans.\\n\\nWith this foundation, you can now understand why `ngrok` (and our DIY one) is so cool! It removes the need for all this additional configuration, while also providing better security. All you need to do is add an extra computer into the mix, like this:\"}],[\"image\",{\"src\":\"/content/images/2021/02/with_ngrok-1.png\",\"width\":1662,\"height\":350,\"cardWidth\":\"wide\",\"alt\":\"Diagram showing the flow of traffic from a users web browser, through the internet, a cloud-based reverse proxy, and finally the users computer. It points out that the only thing the user controls is their machine.\"}],[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"Because you are using a [Reverse Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) to get the traffic from the extra computer to yours, no additional configuration is required on your end. And, when you are done, you can simply shut down the extra machine, and there are no loose ends or open ports left to close!\\n\\nAs mentioned above, this tutorial uses AWS to create the proxy. Other cloud providers will work just as well, but the commands and samples in this document will be for AWS only. [Pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/earthly/example-diy-ngrok), if you want to contribute specific scripts for your cloud provider of choice!\\n\\nOne elephant in the room to address before moving on is the inevitable \\\"Why not (Terraform/Pulumi/Cloud Formation/My Favorite IAAS tool...)?\\\" question. These tools are, in fact, made for setting up and tearing down insfrastructure exactly like this! However, using fewer tools helps keep this tutorial simple and accessible, so only the AWS CLI will be used throughout.\\n\\n## Lets Build It\\n\\nYou will need the following to complete the rest of this tutorial:\\n\\n* An active AWS account [(If you don't have one, you can sign up here)](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start)\\n* [Installed the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)\\n* [Configured AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)\\n\\nOptionally, you may also want to install:\\n\\n* [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\\n\\nWith those in hand, it's time to get started!\\n\\n### Where will the instance live?\\n\\nBefore creating anything in the cloud, you'll need to make sure that you have some information about the VPC and subnet the instance will be assigned to. This information can be found in the console, or on the command-line via `aws ec2 describe-subnets`. It will list all your subnets, and the VPCs they belong to.\\n\\nIf your cloud is like most peoples, you likely have quite a few of these lying around, which makes it difficult to find the one you want to place your proxy in. I like to add `jq` into the mix to make it easier to parse, like this:\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 describe-subnets \\\\\\n    | jq -r '.Subnets[] \\\\\\n    | \\\"\\\\(.AvailabilityZone)\\\\t\\\\(.CidrBlock)\\\\t\\\\(.SubnetId)\\\\t\\\\(.VpcId)\\\"' \\\\\\n    | sort\\n```\\n\\nWhen selecting a subnet, ensure that the one you choose assigns public IP addresses, as you will need to accept traffic from the general internet later.\\n\\n### SSH Keypair\\n\\nThe first thing to create is your EC2 SSH keypair. This is simple to do, especially because the `aws` tool can generate on for you.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 create-key-pair \\\\\\n    --key-name proxy-key-pair \\\\\\n    > key-output.json\\n```\\n\\n| ℹ️ About the AWS CLI output       |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Note the `> key-output.json` at the end. The `aws` CLI tool will always [invoke your system pager with some kind of JSON output as the result of any calls](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration.html#cliv2-migration-output-pager). Because you don't want to lose the key generated by `aws` for our yet-to-be-created instance, capture it here. It's a running trend that you will see throughout this tutorial.|\\n\\nYou can get the key directly with `jq` by `jq -r .KeyPairId key-output.json`, or via your preferred means.\\n\\n### Security Group\\n\\nNow that you have a key pair, you will also need to create a security group for the instance to reside in. To oversimplify, a security group is essentially a firewall for your instance, constraining what ports traffic is allowed to enter or leave on. [You can read more about security groups here, for a longer and more complete explanation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#VPCSecurityGroups) Getting this right is important, so your proxy is less likely to be compromised.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 create-security-group \\\\\\n    --group-name reverse-proxy \\\\\\n    --description reverse-proxy \\\\\\n    --vpc-id $VPC_ID \\\\\\n    > sg-output.json\\n```\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Make sure you replace `$VPC_ID` with the ID for the [VPC you identified earlier](#where-will-the-instance-live).|\\n\\nBy default, AWS security groups are configured to disallow all traffic coming in (ingress), and to allow all traffic out (egress). While an instance that doesn't allow traffic in is fairly secure, it also doesn't do you much good. You will need to open up port 22 (ssh) for traffic from our current IP only, and port 80 (http) for traffic from the internet at large. By restricting SSH to your current IP address, you prevent external entities from attempting to SSH into your proxy.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \\\\\\n    --group-id $SG_ID \\\\\\n    --protocol tcp \\\\\\n    --port 22 \\\\\\n    --cidr $IP/32 \\\\\\n    --no-cli-pager\\n\\n❯ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \\\\\\n    --group-id $SG_ID \\\\\\n    --protocol tcp \\\\\\n    --port 80 \\\\\\n    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \\\\\\n    --no-cli-pager\\n```\\n\\n| ℹ️ Find your public IP from the command line |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| AWS has a public service that returns your IP to you. It's super handy for scripting, because its much clearer to read than the most popular `dig`-based examples passed around on the internet. You can use it like this: `curl -s https://checkip.amazonaws.com` |\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Make sure you replace `$SG_ID` with the ID for the security group you created earlier. If you saved the output like the sample earlier, you can get it by running `jq -r .GroupId sg-output.json`. Also, make sure you replace `$IP` with your _public_ IP address.|\\n\\n### EC2 Instance\\n\\nNow that you have keys, and a security group configured in AWS, you're finally ready to create your EC2 instance! Its easiest for this kind of work to use a `t2.micro`, since that is available on AWS' free tier. If your account is older than 1 year, this instance is still among the cheapest to provision. If a `t2.micro` is too expensive, you may want to size down to a `t2.nano`, or consider [spot instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/), which are beyond the scope of this tutorial. The instance will be provisioned with an AMI using Amazon Linux 2, to keep things as simple as possible.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 run-instances \\\\\\n    --image-id resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2 \\\\\\n    --count 1 \\\\\\n    --instance-type t2.micro \\\\\\n    --key-name $KEY_NAME \\\\\\n    --security-group-ids $SG_ID \\\\\\n    --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \\\\\\n    > ec2-output.json\\n```\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Make sure you replace `$KEY_NAME` with the name (_not id_) of the keypair you created earlier (`proxy-key-pair`). Also make sure you replace `$SG_ID` with the ID for the security group you created earlier, and `$SUBNET_ID` with the subnet you identified before you began.|\\n\\n| ℹ️  EC2 is fast, but not instant |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Although AWS can provision instances very quickly, it can _still_ take a couple minutes for the instance to come up, so be patient! You can wait for the instance on the CLI (if desired) by running the following command: `aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok --instance-ids $EC2_ID`, where `$EC2_ID` is the instance ID from the prior step. |\\n\\nCreating the instance isn't the end of our work, however. You'll still need to configure it to actually reverse proxy the traffic coming in from the internet to our local development machine. To that end, NGINX is a fantastic,battle-tested option. As soon the instance is ready, SSH into the box and install NGINX.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1\\n```\\n\\nNGINX needs to be configured to use the AWS-assigned public DNS name, and proxy traffic from port 80 to you. Heres a sample config you can use:\\n\\n```nginx\\nupstream tunnel {\\n  server 127.0.0.1:8080;\\n}\\n\\nserver {\\n  server_name PUBLIC_DNS;\\n  \\n  location / {\\n    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;\\n    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\\n    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\\n    proxy_redirect off;\\n    \\n    proxy_pass http://tunnel;\\n  }\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Be sure to replace `PUBLIC_DNS` with the AWS public DNS name. This is _not_ in the initial output from AWS, because the DNS name is not granted until the machine enters a running state. You can find itby running `aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $EC2_ID`, where `$EC2_ID` is the ID of the machine you provisioned earlier. This ID _can_ be found in the outputwhen you created the instance by running `jq -r '.Instances[0].InstanceId' ec2-output.json` |\\n\\nSave the completed configuration as `/etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf`.\\n\\nAdditionally, NGINX doesn't quite handle the lengthy public DNS names that AWS hands out, so you'll need to increase `server_names_hash_bucket_size` to the next power of 2, which is `128`. To do this, add `server_names_hash_bucket_size 128` to `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, in the `http` section.\\n\\nNow that NGINX is configured, start it, and exit your SSH session.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ sudo service nginx start\\n\\n...\\n\\n❯ exit\\n```\\n\\n### Using the Proxy\\n\\nNow that the instance is configured, all you will need to do to allow the internet at large to connect to a service running on your local box is to use an `ssh` reverse proxy to get data from AWS to your local machine! Start one up like this:\\n\\n ```bash\\n ❯ ssh -i key.pem -R 8080:localhost:$LOCAL_PORT ec2-user@$PUBLIC_DNS\\n ```\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Replace `$LOCAL_PORT` with the port your application is running on, and `$PUBLIC_DNS` with the AWS-assigned public DNS name, like you did for the NGINX config.|\\n\\nOnce that is up, all you need to do is simply share the AWS public DNS name with anybody you want to allow into your locally-hosted website!\\n\\n## Teardown\\n\\nAlthough you can leave the proxy up for as long as you like, you'll likely need to tear it down eventually. If you have AWS console access, simply terminate the instance, delete the security group, and delete the keypair. If you saved the IDs of these resources (they are in the JSON responses from earlier), you can also do it via the command line:\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ aws ec2 terminate-instances --no-cli-pager --instance-ids $EC2_ID > /dev/null\\n\\n❯ aws ec2 delete-key-pair --no-cli-pager --key-pair-id $KEY_ID && \\\\\\n  aws ec2 delete-security-group --no-cli-pager --group-id $SG_ID\\n```\\n\\nNote that the instance could take a couple minutes to finish terminating. You will not be able to remove the key or security group before the instance has been terminated.\\n\\n## Create using Earthly\\n\\nIf you don't want to deal with manual setup or teardown, we've created an `Earthfile` that should automate all of this for you. It can create a proxy just like this, from scratch, in under five minutes! To start up a proxy using `earthly`, execute this _single_ command.\\n\\n```bash\\n❯ earthly \\\\\\n  --secret-file config=/home/user/.aws/config \\\\\\n  --secret-file credentials=/home/dchw/.aws/credentials \\\\\\n  --build-arg AWS_REGION=my_region \\\\\\n  --build-arg SUBNET_ID=my_subnet \\\\\\n  github.com/earthly/example-diy-ngrok:main+build-proxy\\n```\\n\\n| ℹ️ AWS Credentials |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| The reason you'll need to pass the credentials, is so that our scripts can use them to construct the proxy. If you are uncomfortable passing credentials to a remote target, feel free to clone and inspect the repository before using it. You could also simplify this by trying out Earthly's experimental [cloud-based secrets.](https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/cloud-secrets)|\\n\\n| ❗ Don't Forget                   |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Replace the following:<br><br>`/home/user` with the directory of the AWS configuration directory (`.aws`)<br>`my-region` with the AWS region you use.<br>`my-subnet` with the ID of the subnet you would like to use.<br><br>If you need to use temporary role-based credentials, add `--build-arg AWS_PROFILE=my_profile`, where the profile is the one to assume when creating the resources. |\\n\\nBuilding this container will construct a proxy in the same manner detailed earlier, but with a few extra benefits:\\n\\n* Allows you to retrieve the generated SSH key\\n* Automated teardown of the constructed proxy\\n* Sample SSH Command for proxying\\n* A list of all IDs for all resources created\\n\\nTo see everything it can do, run `docker run proxy:latest` for a list.\\n\\n## Shortcomings\\n\\nThis approach to a free, simple ngrok alternative isn't without its shortcomings. For instance, it can't do `https` without a self-signed certificate, because issuers like Let's Encrypt won't issue certificates for AWS public DNS names. Also, it can't handle a ton of traffic since its a small `t2.micro` capped at low bandwidth.\\n\\nIt also requires non-trivial IAM permissions in AWS to setup and teardown.

However, using fewer tools helps keep this tutorial simple and accessible, so only the AWS CLI will be used throughout.</p>\n<h2 id=\"letsbuildit\">Lets Build It</h2>\n<p>You will need the following to complete the rest of this tutorial:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An active AWS account <a href=\"https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start\">(If you don't have one, you can sign up here)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html\">Installed the AWS CLI</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html\">Configured AWS credentials</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Optionally, you may also want to install:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stedolan.github.io/jq/\">jq</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With those in hand, it's time to get started!</p>\n<h3 id=\"wherewilltheinstancelive\">Where will the instance live?</h3>\n<p>Before creating anything in the cloud, you'll need to make sure that you have some information about the VPC and subnet the instance will be assigned to. This information can be found in the console, or on the command-line via <code>aws ec2 describe-subnets</code>. It will list all your subnets, and the VPCs they belong to.</p>\n<p>If your cloud is like most peoples, you likely have quite a few of these lying around, which makes it difficult to find the one you want to place your proxy in. I like to add <code>jq</code> into the mix to make it easier to parse, like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ aws ec2 describe-subnets \\\n    | jq -r '.Subnets[] \\\n    | &quot;\\(.AvailabilityZone)\\t\\(.CidrBlock)\\t\\(.SubnetId)\\t\\(.VpcId)&quot;' \\\n    | sort\n</code></pre>\n<p>When selecting a subnet, ensure that the one you choose assigns public IP addresses, as you will need to accept traffic from the general internet later.</p>\n<h3 id=\"sshkeypair\">SSH Keypair</h3>\n<p>The first thing to create is your EC2 SSH keypair.

It's a running trend that you will see throughout this tutorial.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>You can get the key directly with <code>jq</code> by <code>jq -r .KeyPairId key-output.json</code>, or via your preferred means.</p>\n<h3 id=\"securitygroup\">Security Group</h3>\n<p>Now that you have a key pair, you will also need to create a security group for the instance to reside in. To oversimplify, a security group is essentially a firewall for your instance, constraining what ports traffic is allowed to enter or leave on. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#VPCSecurityGroups\">You can read more about security groups here, for a longer and more complete explanation.</a> Getting this right is important, so your proxy is less likely to be compromised.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ aws ec2 create-security-group \\\n    --group-name reverse-proxy \\\n    --description reverse-proxy \\\n    --vpc-id $VPC_ID \\\n    &gt; sg-output.json\n</code></pre>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>❗ Don't Forget</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Make sure you replace <code>$VPC_ID</code> with the ID for the <a href=\"#where-will-the-instance-live\">VPC you identified earlier</a>.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>By default, AWS security groups are configured to disallow all traffic coming in (ingress), and to allow all traffic out (egress). While an instance that doesn't allow traffic in is fairly secure, it also doesn't do you much good. You will need to open up port 22 (ssh) for traffic from our current IP only, and port 80 (http) for traffic from the internet at large. By restricting SSH to your current IP address, you prevent external entities from attempting to SSH into your proxy.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \\\n    --group-id $SG_ID \\\n    --protocol tcp \\\n    --port 22 \\\n    --cidr $IP/32 \\\n    --no-cli-pager\n\n❯ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \\\n    --group-id $SG_ID \\\n    --protocol tcp \\\n    --port 80 \\\n    --cidr 0.0.0.0/0 \\\n    --no-cli-pager\n</code></pre>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ℹ️ Find your public IP from the command line</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>AWS has a public service that returns your IP to you.

Its easiest for this kind of work to use a <code>t2.micro</code>, since that is available on AWS' free tier. If your account is older than 1 year, this instance is still among the cheapest to provision. If a <code>t2.micro</code> is too expensive, you may want to size down to a <code>t2.nano</code>, or consider <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/\">spot instances</a>, which are beyond the scope of this tutorial. The instance will be provisioned with an AMI using Amazon Linux 2, to keep things as simple as possible.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ aws ec2 run-instances \\\n    --image-id resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2 \\\n    --count 1 \\\n    --instance-type t2.micro \\\n    --key-name $KEY_NAME \\\n    --security-group-ids $SG_ID \\\n    --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \\\n    &gt; ec2-output.json\n</code></pre>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>❗ Don't Forget</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Make sure you replace <code>$KEY_NAME</code> with the name (<em>not id</em>) of the keypair you created earlier (<code>proxy-key-pair</code>).

You'll still need to configure it to actually reverse proxy the traffic coming in from the internet to our local development machine. To that end, NGINX is a fantastic,battle-tested option. As soon the instance is ready, SSH into the box and install NGINX.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1\n</code></pre>\n<p>NGINX needs to be configured to use the AWS-assigned public DNS name, and proxy traffic from port 80 to you.

To do this, add <code>server_names_hash_bucket_size 128</code> to <code>/etc/nginx/nginx.conf</code>, in the <code>http</code> section.</p>\n<p>Now that NGINX is configured, start it, and exit your SSH session.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ sudo service nginx start\n\n...\n\n❯ exit\n</code></pre>\n<h3 id=\"usingtheproxy\">Using the Proxy</h3>\n<p>Now that the instance is configured, all you will need to do to allow the internet at large to connect to a service running on your local box is to use an <code>ssh</code> reverse proxy to get data from AWS to your local machine!

If you have AWS console access, simply terminate the instance, delete the security group, and delete the keypair. If you saved the IDs of these resources (they are in the JSON responses from earlier), you can also do it via the command line:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">❯ aws ec2 terminate-instances --no-cli-pager --instance-ids $EC2_ID &gt; /dev/null\n\n❯ aws ec2 delete-key-pair --no-cli-pager --key-pair-id $KEY_ID &amp;&amp; \\\n  aws ec2 delete-security-group --no-cli-pager --group-id $SG_ID\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that the instance could take a couple minutes to finish terminating.

For instance, it can't do <code>https</code> without a self-signed certificate, because issuers like Let's Encrypt won't issue certificates for AWS public DNS names. Also, it can't handle a ton of traffic since its a small <code>t2.micro</code> capped at low bandwidth.</p>\n<p>It also requires non-trivial IAM permissions in AWS to setup and teardown.

If you saved the output like the sample earlier, you can get it by\nrunning jq -r .GroupId sg-output.json. Also, make sure you replace $IP with your \npublic IP address.EC2 Instance\nNow that you have keys, and a security group configured in AWS, you're finally\nready to create your EC2 instance! Its easiest for this kind of work to use a \nt2.micro, since that is available on AWS' free tier. If your account is older\nthan 1 year, this instance is still among the cheapest to provision. If a \nt2.micro is too expensive, you may want to size down to a t2.nano, or consider \nspot instances [https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/], which are beyond the scope of\nthis tutorial. The instance will be provisioned with an AMI using Amazon Linux\n2, to keep things as simple as possible.\n\n❯ aws ec2 run-instances \\\n    --image-id resolve:ssm:/aws/service/ami-amazon-linux-latest/amzn2-ami-hvm-x86_64-gp2 \\\n    --count 1 \\\n    --instance-type t2.micro \\\n    --key-name $KEY_NAME \\\n    --security-group-ids $SG_ID \\\n    --subnet-id $SUBNET_ID \\\n    > ec2-output.json\n\n\n❗ Don't ForgetMake sure you replace $KEY_NAME with the name (not id) of the\nkeypair you created earlier (proxy-key-pair). Also make sure you replace $SG_ID \nwith the ID for the security group you created earlier, and $SUBNET_ID with the\nsubnet you identified before you began.ℹ️ EC2 is fast, but not instantAlthough\nAWS can provision instances very quickly, it can still take a couple minutes for\nthe instance to come up, so be patient! You can wait for the instance on the CLI\n(if desired) by running the following command: aws ec2 wait instance-status-ok\n--instance-ids $EC2_ID, where $EC2_ID is the instance ID from the prior step.\nCreating the instance isn't the end of our work, however. You'll still need to\nconfigure it to actually reverse proxy the traffic coming in from the internet\nto our local development machine. To that end, NGINX is a\nfantastic,battle-tested option. As soon the instance is ready, SSH into the box\nand install NGINX.\n\n❯ sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1\n\n\nNGINX needs to be configured to use the AWS-assigned public DNS name, and proxy\ntraffic from port 80 to you. Heres a sample config you can use:\n\nupstream tunnel {\n  server 127.0.0.1:8080;\n}\n\nserver {\n  server_name PUBLIC_DNS;\n  \n  location / {\n    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP  $remote_addr;\n    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n    proxy_set_header Host $http_host;\n    proxy_redirect off;\n    \n    proxy_pass http://tunnel;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n❗ Don't ForgetBe sure to replace PUBLIC_DNS with the AWS public DNS name. This\nis not in the initial output from AWS, because the DNS name is not granted until\nthe machine enters a running state. You can find itby running aws ec2\ndescribe-instances --instance-ids $EC2_ID, where $EC2_ID is the ID of the\nmachine you provisioned earlier. This ID can be found in the outputwhen you\ncreated the instance by running jq -r '.Instances[0].InstanceId' ec2-output.json\nSave the completed configuration as /etc/nginx/conf.d/server.conf.\n\nAdditionally, NGINX doesn't quite handle the lengthy public DNS names that AWS\nhands out, so you'll need to increase server_names_hash_bucket_size to the next\npower of 2, which is 128. To do this, add server_names_hash_bucket_size 128 to \n/etc/nginx/nginx.conf, in the http section.\n\nNow that NGINX is configured, start it, and exit your SSH session.\n\n❯ sudo service nginx start\n\n...\n\n❯ exit\n\n\nUsing the Proxy\nNow that the instance is configured, all you will need to do to allow the\ninternet at large to connect to a service running on your local box is to use an \nssh reverse proxy to get data from AWS to your local machine! Start one up like\nthis:\n\n❯ ssh -i key.pem -R 8080:localhost:$LOCAL_PORT ec2-user@$PUBLIC_DNS\n\n\n❗ Don't ForgetReplace $LOCAL_PORT with the port your application is running on,\nand $PUBLIC_DNS with the AWS-assigned public DNS name, like you did for the\nNGINX config.Once that is up, all you need to do is simply share the AWS public\nDNS name with anybody you want to allow into your locally-hosted website!\n\nTeardown\nAlthough you can leave the proxy up for as long as you like, you'll likely need\nto tear it down eventually. If you have AWS console access, simply terminate the\ninstance, delete the security group, and delete the keypair. If you saved the\nIDs of these resources (they are in the JSON responses from earlier), you can\nalso do it via the command line:\n\n❯ aws ec2 terminate-instances --no-cli-pager --instance-ids $EC2_ID > /dev/null\n\n❯ aws ec2 delete-key-pair --no-cli-pager --key-pair-id $KEY_ID && \\\n  aws ec2 delete-security-group --no-cli-pager --group-id $SG_ID\n\n\nNote that the instance could take a couple minutes to finish terminating. You\nwill not be able to remove the key or security group before the instance has\nbeen terminated.\n\nCreate using Earthly\nIf you don't want to deal with manual setup or teardown, we've created an \nEarthfile that should automate all of this for you. It can create a proxy just\nlike this, from scratch, in under five minutes! To start up a proxy using \nearthly, execute this single command.\n\n❯ earthly \\\n  --secret-file config=/home/user/.aws/config \\\n  --secret-file credentials=/home/dchw/.aws/credentials \\\n  --build-arg AWS_REGION=my_region \\\n  --build-arg SUBNET_ID=my_subnet \\\n  github.com/earthly/example-diy-ngrok:main+build-proxy\n\n\nℹ️ AWS CredentialsThe reason you'll need to pass the credentials, is so that our\nscripts can use them to construct the proxy. If you are uncomfortable passing\ncredentials to a remote target, feel free to clone and inspect the repository\nbefore using it. You could also simplify this by trying out Earthly's\nexperimental cloud-based secrets.\n[https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/cloud-secrets]❗ Don't ForgetReplace the\nfollowing:\n\n/home/user with the directory of the AWS configuration directory (.aws)\nmy-region with the AWS region you use.\nmy-subnet with the ID of the subnet you would like to use.\n\nIf you need to use temporary role-based credentials, add --build-arg\nAWS_PROFILE=my_profile, where the profile is the one to assume when creating the\nresources.Building this container will construct a proxy in the same manner\ndetailed earlier, but with a few extra benefits:\n\n * Allows you to retrieve the generated SSH key\n * Automated teardown of the constructed proxy\n * Sample SSH Command for proxying\n * A list of all IDs for all resources created\n\nTo see everything it can do, run docker run proxy:latest for a list.\n\nShortcomings\nThis approach to a free, simple ngrok alternative isn't without its\nshortcomings. For instance, it can't do https without a self-signed certificate,\nbecause issuers like Let's Encrypt won't issue certificates for AWS public DNS\nnames. Also, it can't handle a ton of traffic since its a small t2.micro capped\nat low bandwidth.\n\nIt also requires non-trivial IAM permissions in AWS to setup and teardown. If\nyou don't have that kind of access to an account, you may end up waiting on\nothers to set it up for you.\n\nConclusion\nTurns out it's pretty simple to get something basic up and running, just like \nngrok does. But, if you find yourself relying on this kind of tooling every day,\nit may be better to pay for a service that can do it better.\n\nThanks for following along with us!

A number of fast-growing tech giants (besides Apple) are pouring a ton of money into making ARM work for a ton of use-cases: Nvidia (trying to [buy ARM Holdings from SoftBank](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/14/nvidia-to-buy-arm-holdings-from-softbank-for-40-billion.html)) and Amazon (deep investment in the new [Graviton processors](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/)) are the two that primarily come to mind.\\n\\nAs you might know, in processors low energy consumption (and low heat dissipation) often equates to the ability to scale processing efficiently for large workloads. It also means longer battery cycles for non-cloud use-cases (less waste, more bang for the buck). This is why I think ARM is the future, even if it might take a decade for the mainstream cloud to migrate over.\\n\\nMy Xeon Linux-based workstation suddenly feels old.\\n\\n## Compatibility\\n\\nAll the software I need to use \\\"just works\\\". I found that if an ARM-native version is not available for an application, the emulated one works just fine and there's no performance drawback that I can notice. To emulate an application, you just need to install Rosetta 2. The OS will automatically detect that Rosetta is needed and prompt you to install it. However, you can also install it manually via\\n\\n```\\n/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta\\n```\\n\\nThe tools you use for development are likely still catching up to this architectural change, and will be for some time. We engineers sometimes use very low-level system capabilities. In some cases, I had to install preview editions of software, but everything worked very well for me. Here are some programs that I've tested:\\n\\n* ✅ Chrome (native)\\n* ✅ 1Password (emulated)\\n* ✅ Zoom (native)\\n* ✅ Backblaze (emulated)\\n* ✅ Signal (emulated)\\n* ✅ Spotify (emulated)\\n* ✅ VS Code. The amd64 version works perfectly well, however, the terminal will be an amd64 process, which may cause some programs to also run as amd64. The arm64 native version is available on the [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/) and works really well.\\n* ✅ Docker. M1 native version is a must. Emulation doesn't have virtualization features, which the Docker app requires. You can download the [Docker App for M1](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/apple-m1/), which is in preview. As mentioned on the documentation page, there are some limitations currently related to HTTP proxy, VPN clients, and performance, but the Docker team is making progress fast. (A month or two ago Kubernetes wasn't working, but now it is!).\\n* ✅ Brew (native, encountered some issues with git, but was able to fix them)\\n* ✅ iTerm 2 (native)\\n* ✅ OBS (emulated)\\n* ✅ Earthly (`v0.5.1+` now supports M1 natively - just `brew install earthly`)\\n\\nI should also mention that during the first few weeks I had some issues with audio skips when using Bluetooth, but an OS update fixed it (just like [Apple promissed](https://www.imore.com/fix-way-m1-mac-bluetooth-problems)).\\n\\nI also use a ✅ YubiKey 5C Nano and a bunch of random peripherals like a ✅ USB microphone and a ✅ dock plugged into Ethernet.\\n\\nLanguages and frameworks I've tested - most of them in Docker containers:\\n\\n* ✅ Go. [1.16 RC adds support for building darwin/arm64 binaries](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin). I built binaries in Docker and ran them natively. Works great.\\n* 🟡 Java and Scala. I had issues with the JVM, experiencing random process hangs. It seems that there are no official OpenJDK builds for aarch64, however there are some community options.

Minimal testing though.\\n* ✅ Rust works fine on native architecture in Docker. Minimal testing though.\\n\\n## How to tell what architecture a program is running as\\n\\nIt's extremely easy to mistake the kind of architecture you run as. Rosetta 2 is that good.\\n\\nThe easiest way to tell the difference is by opening Activity Monitor and looking at the Architecture column: if it says `Apple`, it's ARM. If it says `Intel`, it's X86_64. Here's how I can tell that Zoom is an ARM process, while Spotify is an X86_64 process.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/02/img1.png\\\" alt=\\\"Activity Monitor showing Zoom as an Apple process\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/02/img2.png\\\" alt=\\\"Activity Monitor showing Spotify as an Intel process\\\" style=\\\"max-width:800px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nIf you're not sure about the terminal you're using, you can type `uname -m`. It'll say either `X86_64`, `arm64` (mac) or `aarch64` (linux). `arm64` and `aarch64` are both ARM - `uname` on Mac just reports it differently compared to Linux.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/02/img3.png\\\" alt=\\\"Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' as 'arm64'\\\" style=\\\"max-width:600px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\n## Brew issues\\n\\nOne issue I encountered on both my M1 laptop and also a [MacStadium MacMini](https://www.macstadium.com/m1-mini) instance that we use for Mac testing is that Brew randomly started to complain about git missing. Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.\\n\\n(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)\\n\\nBack to fixing the issue now. Using `brew doctor` I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: `xcode-select --install`. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew `git` via `brew uninstall git` and simply rely on `git` from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: [@vladaionescu](https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu))\\n\\n## Using Docker\\n\\nThe Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.\\n\\nThe Docker for Mac app comes packed with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are `curl`ing some binary that may need to switch from `X86_64` to `aarch64` in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg `shellcheck`).\\n\\nThe Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from [Sebastiaan van Stijn](https://twitter.com/thajeztah), member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).\\n\\n[![We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a \\\"best effort\\\", and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture.](/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png)](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499)\\n\\nAlmost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the [Kafka community image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka) is amd64 only. The [Redis image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the [Docker Hub page for a tag (eg `latest`)](https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore) and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png\\\" alt=\\\"Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown\\\" style=\\\"max-width:600px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nTo build an image for a different architecture, you can use `docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .` instead of the usual `docker build .`. For more details on building multi-platform images see [Akihiro Suda's blog](https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2).\\n\\nIf you `docker pull` an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify `--platform=linux/amd64`.\\n\\nIf you `docker run` an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via `--platform=linux/amd64` if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.\\n\\n<img src=\\\"/content/images/2021/02/img4.png\\\" alt=\\\"Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms\\\" style=\\\"max-width:600px;width:100%\\\">\\n\\nDocker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify `platform: linux/amd64` for the service definition in `docker-compose.yml` if you'd like to be specific.\\n\\nOne thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU ([abandoned PR here](https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7)). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. **However**, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.\\n\\nAnother issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what [@jasmas claims](https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443). I've also seen some [benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638), and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.\\n\\n## Using VS Code\\n\\nNative support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx).\\n\\nEdit: The [latest stable version of VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) now includes the Mac Universal variant.\\n\\nAn issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just that good). In some situations, this led to some strange issues when running Docker, where QEMU was acting up with segmentation faults. After some head-scratching the issue was resolved by switching to the ARM-based VS Code Insiders edition.\\n\\n## Using Earthly\\n\\nWe've added support for Apple M1 in Earthly and so far it's working wonderfully. This is in Beta, so if you end up giving this a try - we'd appreciate any feedback you can give us via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues) or in our [Slack](https://earthly.dev/slack).\\n\\nOne useful Earthly trick I've used a lot is that if one part of your build has not yet been ported to amd64, you can simply mark it as `--platform=linux/amd64` - and thus only that part will execute on amd64. The rest will run natively. This is relatively rare, however - most Docker builds just work across either platform. Our [examples build](https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/b7b640094f8b5a0982eca5376cb54147feac7878/Earthfile#L295-L321) is pretty representative. There's also an extensive guide on [multi-platform builds with Earthly](https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/multi-platform).\\n\\n## Using Go\\n\\nYou don't necessarily need to build `darwin/arm64` binaries to run them on M1. Rosetta 2 emulation works great on Intel ones. If you want to, however, [Go 1.16 RC just added support for this](https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin).\\n\\n## Java / Scala / JVM issues\\n\\nI ran into issues when using the JVM. After investigating online, it seems that OpenJDK is not yet available for the M1. The way this was manifesting for me was that the JVM process would just hang randomly. By using `--platform=linux/amd64` in Docker or in Earthly builds, I was able to get OpenJDK to work most of the time, but I'm still seeing random hangs.\\n\\nAccording to this [StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788005/java-jdk-for-apple-m1-chip), there are [Azul-provided builds of the Zulu JDK](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk) for the M1 and also [Microsoft has put up an aarch64 build for the OpenJDK](https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-aarch64/releases/tag/16-ea%2B10-macos) too. I have not tested these so I can't say whether they work well or not.\\n\\n## Performance\\n\\nOne of the things I noticed about my new laptop is that everything opens up really fast and the awake from sleep time is also really low. These are sub-second differences though so you might not notice it - or maybe it's a placebo acting up on me and there's no real difference :-)\\n\\nDocker is currently slower, however, as mentioned above, due to the multi-core issue. As far as I can tell the difference is approximately 1.75X compared to an Intel MacBook Pro. I would assume that this will be fixed in a future preview of the Docker for Mac app.\\n\\n## Battery life\\n\\nBattery life on the M1 is really really really good - half a day of Zoom meetings + email only took 20% of my battery. I work from home a lot, so I don't use this much. But it's great to know it really lasts for a serious coding session if I needed it on the go.\\n\\n## Cost\\n\\nI can't talk about the M1 without mentioning the cost of the setup. It has very similar specs to the Intel MBP I bought last year, but it's a whole $1000 cheaper. It's crazy. I don't know why - it feels really performant for the most part, it makes no noise, and it has a long-lasting battery.\\n\\nI think the strategy here is that this will be the low-end MacBook Pro of the line-up, while a future Apple Silicon-based one will have even beefier specs.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAs you can see, my workflow is very much Docker-heavy. Docker seems to be working well enough for me and it's taken away any possible pain that may be associated with individual language ecosystem tooling.\\n\\nFor most binaries, if they don't work across platforms natively, Rosetta 2 works wonders on them, or `--platform=linux/amd64` in Docker is all that is needed. The JVM issues were the only ones I could not figure out completely - but also, I did not spend time trying out the Microsoft-provided OpenJDK build or the Zulu JVM.\\n\\nOverall I'm happy with my M1. I like bleeding-edge technology, and I had to use preview versions of some software, but had no major issues in my typical workflow. I'm surprised how well most things just work.\\n\\nIf you're a developer and your coding productivity depends on your laptop, I would triple check that my setup works as expected on an ARM architecture before making a purchase. For the most part you should be fine outside the Java / Scala world - but you never know! QEMU can be hit or miss sometimes.\\n\\nIf you're not a developer, or only use your laptop for browsing and email, I really don't see any reason why you would pick an Intel MacBook over this one.

Not sure what the cause of this is, but it could be the fact that brew has been adding native arm support for many packages in the last few months and it's possible that this migration resulted in some inconsistencies. This is pure speculation, however, I've not researched this.</p>\n<p>(In any case, a very impressive effort to switch architecture so quickly for a project that hosts so many packages!)</p>\n<p>Back to fixing the issue now. Using <code>brew doctor</code> I was able to find out that Xcode needed a (re)install. Easy: <code>xcode-select --install</code>. However, the issue was still there. On the MacStadium instance, I was able to just uninstall brew and reinstall it and everything was fine. I was not as comfortable doing that on my laptop after having installed so much via casks. Instead, I was able to just remove the brew <code>git</code> via <code>brew uninstall git</code> and simply rely on <code>git</code> from Xcode, which seems to work just fine. (If anyone reading this knows what's up with my brew's git and can tell me how to fix it, ping me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VladAIonescu\">@vladaionescu</a>)</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingdocker\">Using Docker</h2>\n<p>The Docker preview worked almost flawlessly for me from day 1. Making use of multi-platform images seems daunting at first, but really it's actually pretty simple.</p>\n<p>The Docker for Mac app comes packed with <a href=\"https://www.qemu.org/\">QEMU</a> out of the box - so Docker is able to run either arm64 and amd64 images. Most official images are now supported on arm64 too. If you're building an image, by default it'll use your native architecture to execute the build (arm64) and most things will usually just work. Your mileage may vary, however, if you are <code>curl</code>ing some binary that may need to switch from <code>X86_64</code> to <code>aarch64</code> in its URL, or if you're doing lower-level stuff. I also noticed that some alpine packages are also not available for ARM (eg <code>shellcheck</code>).</p>\n<p>The Docker team advise that QEMU is a best-effort approach and that it is best to run images natively as much as possible. I have encountered myself issues with some binaries when I tried to emulate them via QEMU. Here's a quote from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thajeztah\">Sebastiaan van Stijn</a>, member of the Moby Technical Steering Comitee (TSC).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-785013499\"><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-01-at-10.58.33-AM.png\" alt=\"We will continue looking to improve the emulation, and are also in talk with 🍏, but it will remain a &quot;best effort&quot;, and mostly to help the transition to ARM becoming more mainstream (both on hosting platforms, and in images). Because of the above, the recommendation is to run images that match the architecture.\"></a></p>\n<p>Almost all of the official images are available for either platform. Third party ones are a mixed bag, with most of the community only offering amd64 versions. As a sample, the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/r/wurstmeister/kafka\">Kafka community image</a> is amd64 only. The <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/_/redis\">Redis image</a> is multi-platform. How can you tell? Go to the <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com/layers/redis/library/redis/latest/images/sha256-bca6e887ba6b58ed572cfecd7043eae16213fd537aa4a65facb9e70eed9c4964?context=explore\">Docker Hub page for a tag (eg <code>latest</code>)</a> and look for this dropdown. If the dropdown exists, it means that it's a multi-platform image.</p>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/Screen-Shot-2021-03-02-at-1.15.36-PM.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of Docker Hub tag page with multi-platform dropdown\" style=\"max-width:600px;width:100%\">\n<p>To build an image for a different architecture, you can use <code>docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 .</code> instead of the usual <code>docker build .</code>. For more details on building multi-platform images see <a href=\"https://medium.com/nttlabs/buildx-multiarch-2c6c2df00ca2\">Akihiro Suda's blog</a>.</p>\n<p>If you <code>docker pull</code> an image from the registry, it will again default to your native architecture (if available), unless you specify <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code>.</p>\n<p>If you <code>docker run</code> an image, it will default to whatever version of the image you have available locally or it will attempt to pull the arm64 version from the registry. You can also override the platform via <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> if you'd like to run the amd64 version specifically.</p>\n<img src=\"/content/images/2021/02/img4.png\" alt=\"Terminal showing the output of 'uname -m' for different platforms\" style=\"max-width:600px;width:100%\">\n<p>Docker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same rules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify <code>platform: linux/amd64</code> for the service definition in <code>docker-compose.yml</code> if you'd like to be specific.</p>\n<p>One thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (<a href=\"https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7\">abandoned PR here</a>). So you cannot run an arm64 Docker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. <strong>However</strong>, if you run your natively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run multi-platform images fine.</p>\n<p>Another issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are currently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that performance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the performance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443\">@jasmas claims</a>. I've also seen some <a href=\"https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638\">benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL</a>, and it seems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple virtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but hopefully these are addressed soon.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingvscode\">Using VS Code</h2>\n<p>Native support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available VS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You can also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both architectures in a single package) available via <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx\">VS Code Insiders</a>.</p>\n<p>Edit: The <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">latest stable version of VS Code</a> now includes the Mac Universal variant.</p>\n<p>An issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the terminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just that good). In some situations, this led to some strange issues when running Docker, where QEMU was acting up with segmentation faults. After some head-scratching the issue was resolved by switching to the ARM-based VS Code Insiders edition.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usingearthly\">Using Earthly</h2>\n<p>We've added support for Apple M1 in Earthly and so far it's working wonderfully. This is in Beta, so if you end up giving this a try - we'd appreciate any feedback you can give us via <a href=\"https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues\">GitHub issues</a> or in our <a href=\"https://earthly.dev/slack\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>One useful Earthly trick I've used a lot is that if one part of your build has not yet been ported to amd64, you can simply mark it as <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> - and thus only that part will execute on amd64. The rest will run natively. This is relatively rare, however - most Docker builds just work across either platform. Our <a href=\"https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/b7b640094f8b5a0982eca5376cb54147feac7878/Earthfile#L295-L321\">examples build</a> is pretty representative. There's also an extensive guide on <a href=\"https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/multi-platform\">multi-platform builds with Earthly</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"usinggo\">Using Go</h2>\n<p>You don't necessarily need to build <code>darwin/arm64</code> binaries to run them on M1. Rosetta 2 emulation works great on Intel ones. If you want to, however, <a href=\"https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin\">Go 1.16 RC just added support for this</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"javascalajvmissues\">Java / Scala / JVM issues</h2>\n<p>I ran into issues when using the JVM. After investigating online, it seems that OpenJDK is not yet available for the M1. The way this was manifesting for me was that the JVM process would just hang randomly. By using <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> in Docker or in Earthly builds, I was able to get OpenJDK to work most of the time, but I'm still seeing random hangs.</p>\n<p>According to this <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788005/java-jdk-for-apple-m1-chip\">StackOverflow thread</a>, there are <a href=\"https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk\">Azul-provided builds of the Zulu JDK</a> for the M1 and also <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-aarch64/releases/tag/16-ea%2B10-macos\">Microsoft has put up an aarch64 build for the OpenJDK</a> too. I have not tested these so I can't say whether they work well or not.</p>\n<h2 id=\"performance\">Performance</h2>\n<p>One of the things I noticed about my new laptop is that everything opens up really fast and the awake from sleep time is also really low. These are sub-second differences though so you might not notice it - or maybe it's a placebo acting up on me and there's no real difference :-)</p>\n<p>Docker is currently slower, however, as mentioned above, due to the multi-core issue. As far as I can tell the difference is approximately 1.75X compared to an Intel MacBook Pro. I would assume that this will be fixed in a future preview of the Docker for Mac app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"batterylife\">Battery life</h2>\n<p>Battery life on the M1 is really really really good - half a day of Zoom meetings + email only took 20% of my battery. I work from home a lot, so I don't use this much. But it's great to know it really lasts for a serious coding session if I needed it on the go.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Cost</h2>\n<p>I can't talk about the M1 without mentioning the cost of the setup. It has very similar specs to the Intel MBP I bought last year, but it's a whole $1000 cheaper. It's crazy. I don't know why - it feels really performant for the most part, it makes no noise, and it has a long-lasting battery.</p>\n<p>I think the strategy here is that this will be the low-end MacBook Pro of the line-up, while a future Apple Silicon-based one will have even beefier specs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>As you can see, my workflow is very much Docker-heavy. Docker seems to be working well enough for me and it's taken away any possible pain that may be associated with individual language ecosystem tooling.</p>\n<p>For most binaries, if they don't work across platforms natively, Rosetta 2 works wonders on them, or <code>--platform=linux/amd64</code> in Docker is all that is needed. The JVM issues were the only ones I could not figure out completely - but also, I did not spend time trying out the Microsoft-provided OpenJDK build or the Zulu JVM.</p>\n<p>Overall I'm happy with my M1. I like bleeding-edge technology, and I had to use preview versions of some software, but had no major issues in my typical workflow. I'm surprised how well most things just work.</p>\n<p>If you're a developer and your coding productivity depends on your laptop, I would triple check that my setup works as expected on an ARM architecture before making a purchase. For the most part you should be fine outside the Java / Scala world - but you never know! QEMU can be hit or miss sometimes.</p>\n<p>If you're not a developer, or only use your laptop for browsing and email, I really don't see any reason why you would pick an Intel MacBook over this one. I would also assume that the MacBook Air version is also amazing (unlike the Intel version of MacBook Air, which is often on the slow side for modern web browsing). The M1 chip is very similar between Pro and Air and there's no need for fans.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","comment_id":"6036e0717350a800452efadc","plaintext":"So I've been using my new M1-based MacBook Pro for a couple of months for a mix\nof development, email, and other things an open-source maintainer\n[https://github.com/earthly/earthly] does day-to-day.\n\nThe typical first reaction that you get when using this is \"it runs my Docker\nstack without sounding like a plane taking off??\".\n\nIt's a pretty amazing piece of engineering, and in many ways, I think that the\nARM architecture is the future.

You can also override the platform via --platform=linux/amd64 if you'd\nlike to run the amd64 version specifically.\n\nDocker Compose will happily run a mixture of various architectures. The same\nrules apply with regards to pulling and running. You can also specify platform:\nlinux/amd64 for the service definition in docker-compose.yml if you'd like to be\nspecific.\n\nOne thing to note is that Docker-in-Docker is not supported by QEMU (abandoned\nPR here [https://github.com/moby/qemu/pull/7]). So you cannot run an arm64\nDocker in an amd64 Docker or vice-versa. However, if you run your\nnatively-supported Docker-in-Docker, the inner Docker can still run\nmulti-platform images fine.\n\nAnother issue that I noticed with the Docker preview on the M1 is that there are\ncurrently performance issues with multi-processor use - so much so that\nperformance using a single core is sometimes slightly better than the\nperformance of using 8 cores. Or at least that's what @jasmas claims\n[https://github.com/docker/roadmap/issues/142#issuecomment-772732443]. I've also\nseen some benchmarks testing the import of a database like MySQL\n[https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/5389#issuecomment-785857638], and it\nseems that there are some clear performance issues (~25X) with the Apple\nvirtualization API. I've not seen such a drastic difference in common use, but\nhopefully these are addressed soon.\n\nUsing VS Code\nNative support for Apple Silicon is not yet available in the generally available\nVS Code version, but running the amd64 emulated version works pretty well. You\ncan also use the native version via a VS Code Universal build (contains both\narchitectures in a single package) available via VS Code Insiders\n[https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx].\n\nEdit: The latest stable version of VS Code [https://code.visualstudio.com/] now\nincludes the Mac Universal variant.\n\nAn issue I ran into with the amd64 version was that I did not realize that the\nterminal was also an amd64 process (Again, Rosetta 2 is just that good). In some\nsituations, this led to some strange issues when running Docker, where QEMU was\nacting up with segmentation faults. After some head-scratching the issue was\nresolved by switching to the ARM-based VS Code Insiders edition.\n\nUsing Earthly\nWe've added support for Apple M1 in Earthly and so far it's working wonderfully.\nThis is in Beta, so if you end up giving this a try - we'd appreciate any\nfeedback you can give us via GitHub issues\n[https://github.com/earthly/earthly/issues] or in our Slack\n[https://earthly.dev/slack].\n\nOne useful Earthly trick I've used a lot is that if one part of your build has\nnot yet been ported to amd64, you can simply mark it as --platform=linux/amd64 -\nand thus only that part will execute on amd64. The rest will run natively. This\nis relatively rare, however - most Docker builds just work across either\nplatform. Our examples build\n[https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/b7b640094f8b5a0982eca5376cb54147feac7878/Earthfile#L295-L321] \nis pretty representative. There's also an extensive guide on multi-platform\nbuilds with Earthly [https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/multi-platform].\n\nUsing Go\nYou don't necessarily need to build darwin/arm64 binaries to run them on M1.\nRosetta 2 emulation works great on Intel ones. If you want to, however, Go 1.16\nRC just added support for this [https://golang.org/doc/go1.16#darwin].\n\nJava / Scala / JVM issues\nI ran into issues when using the JVM. After investigating online, it seems that\nOpenJDK is not yet available for the M1. The way this was manifesting for me was\nthat the JVM process would just hang randomly. By using --platform=linux/amd64 \nin Docker or in Earthly builds, I was able to get OpenJDK to work most of the\ntime, but I'm still seeing random hangs.\n\nAccording to this StackOverflow thread\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64788005/java-jdk-for-apple-m1-chip], there\nare Azul-provided builds of the Zulu JDK\n[https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?package=jdk] for the M1 and also \nMicrosoft has put up an aarch64 build for the OpenJDK\n[https://github.com/microsoft/openjdk-aarch64/releases/tag/16-ea%2B10-macos] \ntoo. I have not tested these so I can't say whether they work well or not.\n\nPerformance\nOne of the things I noticed about my new laptop is that everything opens up\nreally fast and the awake from sleep time is also really low. These are\nsub-second differences though so you might not notice it - or maybe it's a\nplacebo acting up on me and there's no real difference :-)\n\nDocker is currently slower, however, as mentioned above, due to the multi-core\nissue. As far as I can tell the difference is approximately 1.75X compared to an\nIntel MacBook Pro. I would assume that this will be fixed in a future preview of\nthe Docker for Mac app.\n\nBattery life\nBattery life on the M1 is really really really good - half a day of Zoom\nmeetings + email only took 20% of my battery. I work from home a lot, so I don't\nuse this much. But it's great to know it really lasts for a serious coding\nsession if I needed it on the go.\n\nCost\nI can't talk about the M1 without mentioning the cost of the setup. It has very\nsimilar specs to the Intel MBP I bought last year, but it's a whole $1000\ncheaper. It's crazy. I don't know why - it feels really performant for the most\npart, it makes no noise, and it has a long-lasting battery.\n\nI think the strategy here is that this will be the low-end MacBook Pro of the\nline-up, while a future Apple Silicon-based one will have even beefier specs.\n\nConclusion\nAs you can see, my workflow is very much Docker-heavy. Docker seems to be\nworking well enough for me and it's taken away any possible pain that may be\nassociated with individual language ecosystem tooling.\n\nFor most binaries, if they don't work across platforms natively, Rosetta 2 works\nwonders on them, or --platform=linux/amd64 in Docker is all that is needed. The\nJVM issues were the only ones I could not figure out completely - but also, I\ndid not spend time trying out the Microsoft-provided OpenJDK build or the Zulu\nJVM.\n\nOverall I'm happy with my M1. I like bleeding-edge technology, and I had to use\npreview versions of some software, but had no major issues in my typical\nworkflow. I'm surprised how well most things just work.\n\nIf you're a developer and your coding productivity depends on your laptop, I\nwould triple check that my setup works as expected on an ARM architecture before\nmaking a purchase. For the most part you should be fine outside the Java / Scala\nworld - but you never know! QEMU can be hit or miss sometimes.\n\nIf you're not a developer, or only use your laptop for browsing and email, I\nreally don't see any reason why you would pick an Intel MacBook over this one. I\nwould also assume that the MacBook Air version is also amazing (unlike the Intel\nversion of MacBook Air, which is often on the slow side for modern web\nbrowsing). The M1 chip is very similar between Pro and Air and there's no need\nfor fans.","feature_image":"/content/images/2021/02/tomas-stanislavsky-9PRQ44avKik-unsplash-1.jpg","featured":1,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"5f58055ab2bf860039ab8273","created_at":"2021-02-24T23:25:37.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-05T22:25:36.000Z","published_at":"2021-03-03T17:00:00.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"email_recipient_filter":"none"},{"id":"603ea2674fea0c0039ef4bae","uuid":"b47cd7d6-a6de-48ad-b305-4a0894da1f83","title":"How to Setup and Use Amazon's Elastic Container Registry","slug":"how-to-setup-and-use-amazons-elastic-container-registry","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"A container is a simple unit that packages all your code and its dependencies so your application can run quickly and reliably from any computing environment. That means you could quickly move from your local environment to your staging and into production. Due to their portability, small size, and convenience, containers are becoming [a method of choice](https://www.cio.com/article/3434010/more-enterprises-are-using-containers-here-s-why.html) for shipping modern applications.\\n\\nContainers are created from a read-only template called an *Image*. These images need to be stored somewhere so they can be retrieved by any machine authorized to use them. That's where a container registry comes in.\\n\\n## Docker Hub: Where Many Start\\n[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is one of the most well-known pieces of software for working with containerized applications. To help with the storage issue, Docker created [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) - the world's largest container registry - where developers can share and download pre-built images from others.\\n\\nWhile Docker Hub is still the most common option, it's lost a bit of steam since the company started restricting free public repositories to just [a few hundred pulls every 6 hours](https://cloudonaut.io/amazon-ecr-vs-docker-hub-vs-github-container-registry/). Docker Hub also offers some of the same features that ECR does (image scanning, team access) to paid users, but it's likely to be much more expensive than Amazon ECR is when you're starting out.\\n\\nFinally, the free Docker Hub plan has added a restrictive retention policy. They will delete any container images that haven't been accessed within the last six months, so if you're using Docker Hub for your side project that you update only occasionally, you might be surprised to find it suddenly gone one day.\\n\\n## Introducing Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)\\nAmazon ECR is a fully managed container registry offered as part of the AWS suite. Like Docker Hub, it makes storing, sharing, managing, and deploying your images easier, but it's also likely to save you money - especially if you're already using AWS. Simply push your images to ECR and pull the images using container management tool: [Kuberenetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), [ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs), [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks), etc.\\n\\n### Pricing\\nGenerally, public repositories are suitable for open-source developers sharing their work with the world for free. In contrast, private repositories are used by companies to share proprietary images of their internal software. Depending on the privacy level you need, here's how AWS charges for ECR:\\n\\n- **Private Repositories**: As a part of the AWS free tier, you get 500 MB of storage for one year for private repositories. Beyond that, the storage cost is $0.10 per GB-month of data storage for private repositories.\\n- **Public Repositories**: ECR offers 50 GB-month of free storage and 500 GB to 5 TB (depending on whether you authenticate with AWS or not) for public repositories. Beyond that, the storage cost is $0.10 per GB-month of data storage.\\n\\nThere may be additional costs depending on your region and usage, so be sure to check the pricing [here](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/).\\n\\n### Why ECR?\\nIf you're already bought into the Amazon ecosystem, ECR is an obvious choice for your container registry as you won't have to add a new service to your budget. Besides saving you money, ECR integrates with other standard AWS services, which will hopefully improve developer experience as well.\\n\\n### [IAM (Identity and Access Management)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam)\\n[ECR integrates with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policies.html) to configure policies and manage and control access to your images. This means you won't have to share credentials or manage permissions individually for each repository.\\n\\n### [EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks)\\nKubernetes is a widely used container orchestration technology for automating deployments, networking, and scaling your application. Elastic Kubernetes Service is the AWS-managed Kubernetes platform.\\n\\nEKS allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without maintaining your own [Kubernetes control plane](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components). You define a manifest file, and the Kubernetes master node will schedule and run the deployments. As you'll see later, you can use images hosted in ECR in this manifest file to easily deploy your workloads from your public or private repositories.\\n\\n### [ECS (Elastic Container Service)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs) \\nLike EKS, ECS is a container orchestration service that makes running, stopping, and managing containers on AWS resources easy. Without getting into all of the specifics, ECS is typically better for teams that want a simple but powerful way to run their containers, while EKS adds the flexibility and security options available in Kubernetes. To learn more about each of AWS's container orchestration tools, read [this article on picking the right one](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-vs-amazon-eks-making-sense-of-aws-container-services/).\\n\\nWhen integrating with ECR, ECS users simply have to [add their images to a task definition](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_ECS.html). Task definitions are JSON files that describe each container that forms the application. These definitions are similar to Kubernetes manifest files but require their own format and options.\\n\\n## Using Elastic Container Registry\\nIf you've decided that ECR is the right option for your application, you're ready to set up and start using it. In the remainder of this tutorial, I'll walk you through the steps required to get started with ECR. I'll show you how to push and pull images from ECR and how you can use your ECR images in EKS and ECS.\\n\\nTypically these steps will be run as part of your continuous integration workflow, but you can also run them locally to get more familiar with the required tooling before you automate them.\\n\\n### Prerequisites\\n- [AWS Credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) with permissions to interact with ECR.\\n- [Docker installed for your operating system](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).\\n- The [AWS CLI installed locally](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).\\n\\n### Creating a New Repository\\nAssuming you've already got an AWS account and permissions correctly configured, the easiest way to get started is to create a new ECR repository via the Amazon Web Services UI.\\n\\nGo to the [ECR homepage](http://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/get-started) and click the *Get Started* button.\\n\\n![ECR landing page](/content/images/2021/03/1.png)\\n\\nYou will be taken to the *Create repository* page, where you can enter all the details for your new repository.\\n\\n### Configuring Your Repository\\n\\n![Amazon ECR repository creation menu](/content/images/2021/03/createrepo.png)\\n\\nChoose a visibility (*Public* or *Private*), name the repository (ideally something short but self-explanatory), and below the name, select any of the other options you need:\\n\\n- *Tag immutability* - Prevents the same tag from being pushed twice and overwriting a previous version of the tag.\\n- *Scan on push* - Your images will be scanned for security vulnerabilities each time a new tag is pushed.\\n- *[KMS encryption](https://medium.com/@suprajaraman/aws-kms-all-about-keys-564245425ecc)* - Allows you to use AWS Key Management Service (KMS) to encrypt the images in this repository.\\n\\n_Note: your final repository URL structure will be something like this:_\\n\\n```\\n<account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>\\n```\\n\\nOnce your repository is configured, click *Create repository* to initialize your ECR repository. If you want to create a public repository, you can follow the same steps but select `Pubic` instead of `Private`.\\n\\n![Amazon ECR dashboard](/content/images/2021/03/ECR.png)\\n\\n### Pushing an Image to the Repository\\nBefore publishing the Image to ECR, make sure you have Docker installed on your workstation and a project with a Dockerfile that's ready to be built and pushed to ECR.\\n\\nIf you don't have a project ready, create a new file called `Dockerfile` and enter the following (this is based on the official [Docker `alpine:3.7` image](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine)):\\n\\n```\\nFROM alpine:3.7\\nCMD echo 'Hello world'\\n```\\n\\nNext, [set up your AWS credentials on the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) if you haven't already:\\n\\n```\\naws configure\\n```\\n\\nPaste your *AWS Access Key ID* and *AWS Secret Access Key*. This will allow your CLI instance access to your AWS account.\\n\\nIf you're using the CLI as part of your continuous integration workflow, you also have the option [to use environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html) to securely store your credentials.\\n\\n### Adding Your ECR Credentials to the Docker CLI\\nNext, you need Docker to be able to push images to your ECR repository. The [`docker login` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) will allow you to do this, so using the AWS CLI, retrieve your ECR password and pipe it into the Docker command:\\n\\n```\\naws ecr get-login-password \\\\\\n    --region <account-region> \\\\\\n| docker login \\\\\\n    --username AWS \\\\\\n    --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>\\n```\\n\\nAfter authentication, you will see `Login Succeeded` as a response. Now you'll be able to push tagged images to your ECR repository.\\n\\nIf you are pushing or pulling images from this machine regularly, you may not want to go through this login process every time. Instead of using `docker login`, you can configure the [Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper) to give the Docker daemon direct access to your AWS credentials. This method is also convenient for CI environments because it automates the authentication process and caches tokens to minimize your risk of being throttled.\\n\\n### Pushing an Image to ECR\\nNext, build the image from your Dockerfile:\\n\\n```\\ndocker build -t <image-name>:<image-version> .\\n```\\n\\nThen, tag the image with your ECR repository name:\\n\\n```\\ndocker tag <image-name>:<image-version> <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<image-version>\\n```\\n\\nYour image is now ready to push to ECR:\\n\\n```\\ndocker push <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<image-version>\\n```\\n\\nAnd just like that, you have pushed our first image to a repository on Elastic Container Registry. In the next section, you'll see how you can use these images for local or remote deployments.\\n\\n### Pulling an Image from ECR\\nWhether you want to pull an image from a public ECR repository or your company has private images stored in ECR, pulling works in the same way it does in any container registry. After you've authenticated (using the same steps above), you can use [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/):\\n\\n```\\ndocker pull <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<image-version>\\n```\\n\\nNow you can run this image locally.\\n\\n### Using ECR Images in a Dockerfile\\nIf you are building a new application from a base image stored in ECR, you can use the `FROM` command in your Dockerfile just as you would with any other Docker image. For example:\\n\\n```\\nFROM: <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>:<image-version>\\n```\\n\\nAgain, you'll need to be authenticated if you want to build an image off a private image in ECR, but this allows you to share base images with your team or the public.\\n\\n### Using ECR Images in Production Deployments\\nTo use your images from ECR in a container management platform like ECS or EKS, simply add the name and tag of the image you want to use to the relevant configuration file.\\n\\n#### EKS Manifest\\nFor example, you can use the following EKS manifest to deploy a NodeJS image stored in ECR:\\n\\n```\\napiVersion: batch/v1 \\nkind: Job \\nmetadata: \\n    name: eks-iam-test-s3 \\nspec: template: \\n    metadata: \\n      labels: \\n        app: eks-iam-test-s3 \\n    spec: \\n      serviceAccountName: iam-test \\n      containers: \\n        - name: eks-iam-test \\n          image: 123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-nodejs-sample:v1 \\n          args: [\\\"s3\\\", \\\"ls\\\"] \\n      restartPolicy: Never\\n```\\n\\nWhen deployed, it will create a job with the name `eks-iam-test-s3` using the `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-nodejs-sample:v1` image. To see the complete step-by-step process for deploying this job to EKS, see [the AWS documentation here](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_EKS.html).\\n\\n#### ECS Task Definition\\nECR images can also be used in ECS task definition files to define your containers:\\n\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"containerDefinitions\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"sample-app\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-nodejs-sample:v1\\\",\\n      \\\"memory\\\": 200,\\n      \\\"cpu\\\": 10,\\n      \\\"essential\\\": true\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"family\\\": \\\"example_task_3\\\",\\n  \\\"taskRoleArn\\\": \\\"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/AmazonECSTaskS3BucketRole\\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis definition will deploy a container named `sample-app` using image `123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/aws-nodejs-sample:v1`. More detailed steps are [available in the ECS documentation here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-task-definition.html).\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nIn this tutorial, you learned the basics of containers and container registries. You learned about the differences between Docker Hub and Amazon ECR for public and private repository hosting, and you saw how to set up and use ECR to store your images.\\n\\nWhether you're using Docker images in production or not, ECR is a useful tool if you're already embedded in the AWS ecosystem. It gives you the advantage of working well with other Amazon services like IAM for security and ECS or EKS for deployments.\\n\\nIf you are pushing images to ECR as part of your build pipeline, check out Earthly's support for [ECR credentials](https://docs.earthly.dev/guides/configuring-registries/aws-ecr#install-and-configure-the-ecr-credential-helper). Unlike other build tools, Earthly executes each CI build in an isolated containerized environment, and it can pull images from ECR or any other container registry you choose.

Instead of using <code>docker login</code>, you can configure the <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper\">Amazon ECR Docker Credential Helper</a> to give the Docker daemon direct access to your AWS credentials. This method is also convenient for CI environments because it automates the authentication process and caches tokens to minimize your risk of being throttled.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pushinganimagetoecr\">Pushing an Image to ECR</h3>\n<p>Next, build the image from your Dockerfile:</p>\n<pre><code>docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;image-version&gt; .\n</code></pre>\n<p>Then, tag the image with your ECR repository name:</p>\n<pre><code>docker tag &lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;image-version&gt; &lt;account-id&gt;.dkr.ecr.&lt;account-region&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;:&lt;image-version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your image is now ready to push to ECR:</p>\n<pre><code>docker push &lt;account-id&gt;.dkr.ecr.&lt;account-region&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;:&lt;image-version&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>And just like that, you have pushed our first image to a repository on Elastic Container Registry.

Due to their portability, small size, and convenience,\ncontainers are becoming a method of choice\n[https://www.cio.com/article/3434010/more-enterprises-are-using-containers-here-s-why.html] \nfor shipping modern applications.\n\nContainers are created from a read-only template called an Image. These images\nneed to be stored somewhere so they can be retrieved by any machine authorized\nto use them. That's where a container registry comes in.\n\nDocker Hub: Where Many Start\nDocker [https://www.docker.com/] is one of the most well-known pieces of\nsoftware for working with containerized applications. To help with the storage\nissue, Docker created Docker Hub [https://hub.docker.com/] - the world's largest\ncontainer registry - where developers can share and download pre-built images\nfrom others.\n\nWhile Docker Hub is still the most common option, it's lost a bit of steam since\nthe company started restricting free public repositories to just a few hundred\npulls every 6 hours\n[https://cloudonaut.io/amazon-ecr-vs-docker-hub-vs-github-container-registry/].\nDocker Hub also offers some of the same features that ECR does (image scanning,\nteam access) to paid users, but it's likely to be much more expensive than\nAmazon ECR is when you're starting out.\n\nFinally, the free Docker Hub plan has added a restrictive retention policy. They\nwill delete any container images that haven't been accessed within the last six\nmonths, so if you're using Docker Hub for your side project that you update only\noccasionally, you might be surprised to find it suddenly gone one day.\n\nIntroducing Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)\nAmazon ECR is a fully managed container registry offered as part of the AWS\nsuite. Like Docker Hub, it makes storing, sharing, managing, and deploying your\nimages easier, but it's also likely to save you money - especially if you're\nalready using AWS. Simply push your images to ECR and pull the images using\ncontainer management tool: Kuberenetes [https://kubernetes.io/], Docker Compose\n[https://docs.docker.com/compose/], ECS [https://aws.amazon.com/ecs], EKS\n[https://aws.amazon.com/eks], etc.\n\nPricing\nGenerally, public repositories are suitable for open-source developers sharing\ntheir work with the world for free. In contrast, private repositories are used\nby companies to share proprietary images of their internal software. Depending\non the privacy level you need, here's how AWS charges for ECR:\n\n * Private Repositories: As a part of the AWS free tier, you get 500 MB of\n   storage for one year for private repositories. Beyond that, the storage cost\n   is $0.10 per GB-month of data storage for private repositories.\n * Public Repositories: ECR offers 50 GB-month of free storage and 500 GB to 5\n   TB (depending on whether you authenticate with AWS or not) for public\n   repositories. Beyond that, the storage cost is $0.10 per GB-month of data\n   storage.\n\nThere may be additional costs depending on your region and usage, so be sure to\ncheck the pricing here [https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/pricing/].\n\nWhy ECR?\nIf you're already bought into the Amazon ecosystem, ECR is an obvious choice for\nyour container registry as you won't have to add a new service to your budget.\nBesides saving you money, ECR integrates with other standard AWS services, which\nwill hopefully improve developer experience as well.\n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) [https://aws.amazon.com/iam]\nECR integrates with IAM\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policies.html] \nto configure policies and manage and control access to your images. This means\nyou won't have to share credentials or manage permissions individually for each\nrepository.\n\nEKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) [https://aws.amazon.com/eks]\nKubernetes is a widely used container orchestration technology for automating\ndeployments, networking, and scaling your application. Elastic Kubernetes\nService is the AWS-managed Kubernetes platform.\n\nEKS allows you to run Kubernetes on AWS without maintaining your own Kubernetes\ncontrol plane\n[https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#control-plane-components]\n. You define a manifest file, and the Kubernetes master node will schedule and\nrun the deployments. As you'll see later, you can use images hosted in ECR in\nthis manifest file to easily deploy your workloads from your public or private\nrepositories.\n\nECS (Elastic Container Service) [https://aws.amazon.com/ecs]\nLike EKS, ECS is a container orchestration service that makes running, stopping,\nand managing containers on AWS resources easy. Without getting into all of the\nspecifics, ECS is typically better for teams that want a simple but powerful way\nto run their containers, while EKS adds the flexibility and security options\navailable in Kubernetes. To learn more about each of AWS's container\norchestration tools, read this article on picking the right one\n[https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/amazon-ecs-vs-amazon-eks-making-sense-of-aws-container-services/]\n.\n\nWhen integrating with ECR, ECS users simply have to add their images to a task\ndefinition\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/ECR_on_ECS.html]. Task\ndefinitions are JSON files that describe each container that forms the\napplication. These definitions are similar to Kubernetes manifest files but\nrequire their own format and options.\n\nUsing Elastic Container Registry\nIf you've decided that ECR is the right option for your application, you're\nready to set up and start using it. In the remainder of this tutorial, I'll walk\nyou through the steps required to get started with ECR.

If you want to create a public repository, you can follow the\nsame steps but select Pubic instead of Private.\n\n\n\nPushing an Image to the Repository\nBefore publishing the Image to ECR, make sure you have Docker installed on your\nworkstation and a project with a Dockerfile that's ready to be built and pushed\nto ECR.\n\nIf you don't have a project ready, create a new file called Dockerfile and enter\nthe following (this is based on the official Docker alpine:3.7 image\n[https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine]):\n\nFROM alpine:3.7\nCMD echo 'Hello world'\n\n\nNext, set up your AWS credentials on the CLI\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html] \nif you haven't already:\n\naws configure\n\n\nPaste your AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key. This will allow your CLI\ninstance access to your AWS account.\n\nIf you're using the CLI as part of your continuous integration workflow, you\nalso have the option to use environment variables\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html] to\nsecurely store your credentials.\n\nAdding Your ECR Credentials to the Docker CLI\nNext, you need Docker to be able to push images to your ECR repository. The \ndocker login command\n[https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/] will allow you to\ndo this, so using the AWS CLI, retrieve your ECR password and pipe it into the\nDocker command:\n\naws ecr get-login-password \\\n    --region <account-region> \\\n| docker login \\\n    --username AWS \\\n    --password-stdin <account-id>.dkr.ecr.<account-region>.amazonaws.com/<repository-name>\n\n\nAfter authentication, you will see Login Succeeded as a response.

Once you've deployed your application, logging is one of the best tools to help reveal errors, aid in debugging, and optimize your application's performance.\\n\\nWith that in mind, let's dive into Docker logging and its log files.\\n\\n## Introduction to Docker Logging\\n\\nDevelopers, DevOps professionals, and product stakeholders all apply knowledge gained from logging to improve a system's performance and reliability. Much of what an application, server, or OS does should be recorded in the logs and aggregated in an easily accessible location. A [log analysis](https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/log-analysis/) then uses all the log events and audit trails to help chalk out a clear picture of events that happen across your application.\\n\\nIn [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), containers are isolated and bundled with software, libraries, and configuration files. In a traditional single-server setup log analysis is centralized on a single node, but with a stateless containerized setup logging becomes more complex. Why? Two reasons:\\n\\n**1. Containers are transient.** When a Docker container broadcasts logs, it sends them to the application's `stdout` and `stderr` output streams. The underlying container logging driver can start accessing these streams, and the logs are stored on the Docker host in JSON files ([`json-file` is the default logging driver used by Docker](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/)). It writes JSON-formatted logs to a file on the host where the container is running. Any logs stored in the container will be deleted when it is terminated or shut down.\\n\\n**2. Containers are multileveled.** There are two levels of aggregation in Docker logging. One refers to the logs from inside the container in your Dockerized application, and the second refers to the logs from the host servers (eg, system logs, Docker daemon logs), which are generally located in `/var/log`. A log aggregator that has access to the host pulls application log files and accesses the file system inside the container to collect the logs. Later, you'd need to correlate these log events for analysis.\\n\\nIn this article, you'll learn about different logging strategies you can use in a Dockerized application—how you can access logs and understand Docker logging commands, drivers, configuration, and management to build a highly performant and reliable infrastructure.\\n\\n## Docker Logging Commands\\n\\n`docker logs` is a command that shows all the information logged by a running container. The `docker service logs` command shows information logged by all the containers participating in a service. By default, the output of these commands, as it would appear if you run the command in a terminal, opens up three I/O streams: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. And the default is set to show only STDOUT and STDERR.\\n\\n- STDIN is the command's input stream, which may include input from the keyboard or input from another command. \\n- STDOUT is usually a command's normal output. \\n- STDERR is typically used to output error messages. \\n\\nThe `docker logs` command may not be useful in cases when a logging driver is configured to send logs to a file, database, or an external host/backend, or if the image is configured to send logs to a file instead of STDOUT and STDERR. With `docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>`, you can see all the logs broadcasted by a specific container identified by a unique ID.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker run --name test -d busybox sh -c \\\"while true; do $(echo date); sleep 1; done\\\"\\n$ date\\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 UTC\\n$ docker logs -f --until=2s test\\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 UTC\\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:01 UTC\\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:02 UTC\\n```\\n\\n`docker logs` works a bit differently in community and enterprise versions. In Docker Enterprise, `docker logs` read logs created by any logging driver, but in Docker CE, it can only read logs created by the json-file, local, and journald drivers.\\n\\nFor example, here's the JSON log created by the [hello-world](https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world) Docker image using the json-file driver:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ {\\\"log\\\":\\\"Hello from Docker!\\\\n\\\",\\\"stream\\\":\\\"stdout\\\",\\\"time\\\":\\\"2021-02-10T00:00:00.000000000Z\\\"}\\n```\\n\\nAs you can see, the log follows a pattern of printing: \\n\\n- Log's origin \\n- Either `stdout` or `stderr` \\n- A timestamp \\n\\nYou can find this log in your Docker host at:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ /var/lib/docker/containers/<container id>/<container id>-json.log  \\n```\\n\\nThese Docker logs are stored in a host container and will build up over time. To address that, you can implement log rotation, which will remove a chunk of logs at specified intervals, and a log aggregator, which can be used to push them into a centralized location for a permanent log repository. You can use this repository for further analysis and improvements in the system down the road.\\n\\nTo find `container_id`, run the `docker ps` command. It'll list all the running containers.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker ps\\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS     NAMES\\ncg95e1yqk810   bar_image  \\\"node index.js\\\"     Y min ago           Up Y min            80/tcp     bar_app\\n```\\n\\nThen, the `docker logs container_id` lists the logs for a particular container.\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker logs <container_id>\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to follow the Docker container logs:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker logs <container_id> -f\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to see the last N log lines:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker logs <container_id> --tail N\\n```\\n\\nIf you only want to see any specific logs, use `grep`:\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker logs <container_id> | grep node\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to check errors: \\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker logs <container_id> | grep -i error\\n```\\n\\n## Logging Drivers Supported by Docker\\n\\nLogging drivers, or log-drivers, are mechanisms for getting information from running containers and services, and Docker has lots of them available for you. Every Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses. Docker uses the json-file logging driver as its default driver.\\n\\nCurrently, Docker supports the following logging drivers:\\n\\n|                                     Driver                                      |                                               Description                                               |\\n| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\\n|                                    **none**                                     |            No logs are available for the container and Docker logs do not return any output.            |\\n|      **[local](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/)**      |                    Logs are stored in a custom format designed for minimal overhead.                    |\\n|  **[json-file](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/)**  |                 Logs are formatted as JSON. The default logging driver for Docker.                  |\\n|     **[syslog](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/syslog/)**     | Writes logging messages to the Syslog facility. The Syslog daemon must be running on the host machine.  |\\n|   **[journald](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/)**   |        Writes log messages to journald. The journald daemon must be running on the host machine.         |\\n|    **[gcplogs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gcplogs/)**    |                       Writes log messages to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) logging.                       |\\n|    **[awslogs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/awslogs/)**    |                             Writes log messages to Amazon CloudWatch logs.                              |\\n|     **[splunk](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/)**     |                      Writes log messages to Splunk using the HTTP Event Collector.                      |\\n|       **[gelf](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/gelf/)**       |    Writes log messages to a Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF) endpoint, such as Graylog or Logstash.    |\\n|    **[fluentd](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/fluentd/)**    | Writes log messages to fluentd (forward input). The fluentd daemon must be running on the host machine. |\\n|    **[etwlogs](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/etwlogs/)**    |   Writes log messages as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) events. Only available on Windows platforms.   |\\n| **[logentries](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/logentries/)** |                                Writes log messages to Rapid7 Logentries.                                |\\n\\n\\n### Configuring the Logging Driver\\n\\nTo configure the Docker daemon to a logging driver, you need to set the value of `log-driver` to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json configuration file. Then you need to restart Docker for the changes to take effect for all the newly created containers. All the existing containers will remain as they are.\\n\\nFor example, let's set up a default logging driver with some additional options.\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"log-driver\\\": \\\"json-file\\\",\\n  \\\"log-opts\\\": {\\n    \\\"max-size\\\": \\\"25m\\\",\\n    \\\"max-file\\\": \\\"10\\\",\\n    \\\"labels\\\": \\\"production_bind\\\",\\n    \\\"env\\\": \\\"os,customer\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTo find the current logging driver for the Docker daemon: \\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'\\n\\njson-file\\n```\\n\\nYou can override the default driver by adding the `--log-driver` option to the docker run command that creates a container. \\n\\nThe following command will start using the Splunk driver:\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker run --log-driver splunk httpd\\n```\\n\\nModify the `daemon.json` file, to pass the address of the splunk host to the driver:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"log-driver\\\": \\\"splunk\\\",\\n    \\\"log-opts\\\": {\\n        \\\"splunk-url\\\": \\\"172.1.1.1:11111\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n$ docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' <CONTAINER>\\n\\nsplunk\\n```\\n\\n### Choosing the Delivery Mode of Log Messages From Container to Log Driver\\n\\nDocker provides two modes for delivering log messages:\\n\\n- **Blocking (default):** The container interrupts the application every time it needs to deliver a message to the driver. This will add latency in the performance of your application (for some drivers), but it'll guarantee that all the messages will be sent to the driver. Case in point, the json-file driver writes logs very quickly, therefore it's unlikely to cause latency. But drivers like `gcplogs` and `awslogs` open a connection to a remote server and so are more likely to block and cause latency.\\n\\n- **Non-Blocking:** The container writes and stores its logs to an in-memory ring buffer until the logging driver is available to process them. This ensures that a high rate of logging will not affect application performance. It does not guarantee that all the messages will be sent to the driver. In cases where log broadcasts are faster than the driver processor, the ring buffer will soon run out of space. As a result, buffered logs are deleted to make space for the next set of incoming logs. The default value for `max-buffer-size` is 1 MB.\\n\\nTo change the mode:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\\"log-driver\\\": \\\"splunk\\\",\\n    \\\"log-opts\\\": {\\n        \\\"splunk-url\\\": \\\"172.1.1.1:11111\\\",\\n        \\\"mode\\\": \\\"non-blocking\\\"\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n## Understanding Logging Strategies\\n\\nDocker logging effectively means logging the events of an application, host OS, and the respective Docker service. There are a few defined logging strategies you should keep in mind when working with containerized apps.\\n\\n### 1. Application Logging\\n\\nIn this logging strategy, the application running in the containers will have its own logging framework. For example, a Node.js app could use a [`winston`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston) library to format and send the logs. With this approach, you have complete control over the logging event.\\n\\nIf you have multiple containers, you need to add an identifier at each container level, so you can uniquely determine the container and its respective logs. But as the size of the logs increases, this will start creating a load on the application process. Due to the transient nature of containers, the logs will be wiped out when a container is terminated or shut down. \\n\\nTo address this, you have two options:\\n- Configure steady storage to hold these logs, i.e. disks/data volumes.\\n- Forward these logs to a log management solution.\\n\\n### 2. Data Volumes\\n\\nIn this logging strategy, your container's directory gets links to one of the host machine directories that will hold all the data for you. Containers can now be terminated or shut down, and access logs from multiple containers.\\n\\nA regular backup is a good idea in order to prevent data corruption or loss in case of a failure. But if you want to shift the containers on different hosts without loss of data, then the data volumes strategy will make that difficult.\\n\\n### 3. Docker Logging Driver\\n\\nDocker has a bunch of logging drivers that can be used in your logging strategy. The configured driver reads the data broadcast by the container's `stdout` or `stderr` streams and writes it to a file on the host machine. By default, the host machine holds the log files, but you can forward these events using the available drivers, like fluentd, Splunk, and awslogs.\\n\\nNote that the `docker log` command will not work if you use anything other than the `json-file` driver. And if log forwarding over a TCP connection fails or becomes unreachable, the containers will shut down.\\n\\n### 4. Dedicated Logging Container\\n\\nHere, you need to set up a dedicated container whose only job is to collect and manage logs within a Docker ecosystem. It'll aggregate, monitor, and analyze logs from containers and forward them to a central repository. The log dependency on the host machine is no longer an issue, and it's best suited for microservices architecture.\\n\\nThis strategy gives you the freedom to: \\n\\n- Move containers between the hosts.\\n- Scale up by just adding a new container.\\n- Tie up all the various streams of log events.\\n\\n### 5. Sidecar Logging Container\\n\\nThis logging strategy is similar to dedicated logging in that you have a container to hold logs, but here, each application has its own dedicated logging container (note that the application and its log container can be considered as a single unit). This opens up the flexibility of app-level logging customization. By adding custom identifiers, you can identify the specific container that broadcasts the log.\\n\\nThis is best suited for a complex system where each entity customizes the logs, making it popular in microservices deployment. Maintaining a container per application level will require additional resources for management and setup, so it's complex to implement. Also, you may end up losing data when a container from the unit becomes unserviceable.\\n\\n### 6. Third-party Logging Services\\n\\nThere are a lot of third-party logging services you can use according to your infrastructure and application needs, enabling you to aggregate, manage, and analyze logs and take proactive preventative actions as a result.\\n\\n- **[Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/):** Splunk is built to scale from a single server to multiple data centers. It has built-in alerting and reporting, real-time search, analysis, and visualization, which helps you take action against malfunctions faster. It comes with a Splunk Enterprise on-premise deployment and Splunk Cloud. The free plan comes with 500 MB data per day, and the paid plan starts from $150 a month for a GB.\\n- **[Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash):** Logstash is part of the [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/products) along with Beats, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. It's a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favourite \\\"stash.\\\" Logstash has over 200 plugins for input, filter/transform, and output. It's free and open source.\\n- **[Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org/):** Fluentd is an open-source data collector. Its performance has been well proven, handling 5 TB of daily data, 50,000 messages/sec at peak time. The main reason to use it would be performance. It's free and open source.\\n- **[PaperTrail](https://www.papertrail.com/):** PaperTrail is a simple and user-friendly service that provides a terminal-like experience. Once the data is sent over the syslog, you can perform tail and search operations with the PaperTrail UI. It's affordable for low volumes but becomes expensive for higher volume. It comes with a free 50 MB/month plan, and paid plans start at $7/month for 1 GB per month.\\n- **[Loggly](https://www.loggly.com/):** Loggly focuses on simplicity and ease of use for a DevOps audience. It's one of the more robust log analyzers. Primary use cases are for troubleshooting and customer support scenarios, and it provides richer visualizations and more parsing functionality than PaperTrail. It comes with a free 200 MB/day, and paid plans start at $79 a month for 1 GB per day ingestion with a 2 weeks retention.\\n\\n## Limitations and Challenges of Docker Logging\\n\\nDocker makes containerized application deployment easier, faster, and streamlines it with limited resources. Log management and analysis are handled differently with Docker as compared to a traditional system, which introduces a new set of challenges and limitations. From storing logs in a file system to forwarding them to a central repository, Docker logging has some pain points you'll need to overcome with a deeper understanding of Docker capability.\\n\\n### The Only Compatible Driver Is json-file\\n\\nThe json-file driver is the only one that works with the `docker logs` command, a limitation of Docker logs. When you start using any other logging drivers, such as Fluentd or Splunk, the `docker logs` command shows an error and the Docker logs API calls will fail. Also, you won't be able to check the container logs in this situation.\\n\\n### Docker Syslog Impacts Container Deployment \\n\\nThe reliable way to deliver logs is via Docker Syslog with TCP or TLS. But this driver needs an established TCP connection to the Syslog server whenever a container starts up. And the container will fail ife a connection is not made.\\n\\n  ```bash\\n  $ docker: Error response from daemon: Failed to initialize logging driver: dial tcp\\n  ```\\n\\nYour container deployment will be affected if you face network problems or latency issues. And it's not recommended that you restart the Syslog server because this will drop all the connections from the containers to a central Syslog server.\\n\\n### Potential Loss of Logs with Docker Syslog Driver\\n\\nThe Docker syslog driver needs an established TCP or TLS connection to deliver logs. Note that when the connection is down or not reachable, you'll start losing the logs until the connection reestablished.\\n\\n### Multiline Logs Not Supported\\n  \\nGenerally, either of two patterns is followed for logging: single-line per log or multiple lines with extended information per log, like stack traces or exceptions. But with Docker logging, this is a moot point, because containers always broadcast logs to the same output: `stdout`.\\n### Multiple Logging Drivers Not Supported\\nIt's mandatory that you use only a single driver for all of your logging needs. Scenarios where you can store logs locally and push it to remote servers are not supported.\\n\\n### Logs Can Miss or Skip\\n  \\nThere's a rate limitation setting at the Docker end for journald drivers that takes care of the rate that logs get pushed. If it exceeds, then the driver might skip some logs. To prevent such issues, increase the rate limitation settings according to your logging needs. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile Docker containerization allows developers to encapsulate a program and its file system into a single portable package, that certainly doesn't mean containerization is free of maintenance. Docker Logging is a bit more complex than traditional methods, so teams using Docker must familiarize themselves with the Docker logging to support full-stack visibility, troubleshooting, performance improvements, root cause analysis, etc. \\n\\nAs we have seen in this post, to facilitate logging, Docker offers logging drivers and commands in the platform which gives you the mechanisms for accessing the performance data and also provides plugins to integrate with third-party logging tools as well. To maximize the logging capabilities there are several methods and strategies which help in designing your logging infrastructure, but each comes with its advantages and disadvantages.\\n\\nWith this understanding of logging, containerization can be a powerful tool.

This will add latency in the performance of your application (for some drivers), but it'll guarantee that all the messages will be sent to the driver.

There are a few defined logging strategies you should keep in mind when working with containerized apps.</p>\n<h3 id=\"1applicationlogging\">1. Application Logging</h3>\n<p>In this logging strategy, the application running in the containers will have its own logging framework. For example, a Node.js app could use a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston\"><code>winston</code></a> library to format and send the logs. With this approach, you have complete control over the logging event.</p>\n<p>If you have multiple containers, you need to add an identifier at each container level, so you can uniquely determine the container and its respective logs. But as the size of the logs increases, this will start creating a load on the application process. Due to the transient nature of containers, the logs will be wiped out when a container is terminated or shut down.</p>\n<p>To address this, you have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Configure steady storage to hold these logs, i.e. disks/data volumes.</li>\n<li>Forward these logs to a log management solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"2datavolumes\">2. Data Volumes</h3>\n<p>In this logging strategy, your container's directory gets links to one of the host machine directories that will hold all the data for you. Containers can now be terminated or shut down, and access logs from multiple containers.</p>\n<p>A regular backup is a good idea in order to prevent data corruption or loss in case of a failure. But if you want to shift the containers on different hosts without loss of data, then the data volumes strategy will make that difficult.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3dockerloggingdriver\">3. Docker Logging Driver</h3>\n<p>Docker has a bunch of logging drivers that can be used in your logging strategy. The configured driver reads the data broadcast by the container's <code>stdout</code> or <code>stderr</code> streams and writes it to a file on the host machine. By default, the host machine holds the log files, but you can forward these events using the available drivers, like fluentd, Splunk, and awslogs.</p>\n<p>Note that the <code>docker log</code> command will not work if you use anything other than the <code>json-file</code> driver. And if log forwarding over a TCP connection fails or becomes unreachable, the containers will shut down.</p>\n<h3 id=\"4dedicatedloggingcontainer\">4. Dedicated Logging Container</h3>\n<p>Here, you need to set up a dedicated container whose only job is to collect and manage logs within a Docker ecosystem. It'll aggregate, monitor, and analyze logs from containers and forward them to a central repository. The log dependency on the host machine is no longer an issue, and it's best suited for microservices architecture.</p>\n<p>This strategy gives you the freedom to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Move containers between the hosts.</li>\n<li>Scale up by just adding a new container.</li>\n<li>Tie up all the various streams of log events.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"5sidecarloggingcontainer\">5. Sidecar Logging Container</h3>\n<p>This logging strategy is similar to dedicated logging in that you have a container to hold logs, but here, each application has its own dedicated logging container (note that the application and its log container can be considered as a single unit). This opens up the flexibility of app-level logging customization. By adding custom identifiers, you can identify the specific container that broadcasts the log.</p>\n<p>This is best suited for a complex system where each entity customizes the logs, making it popular in microservices deployment. Maintaining a container per application level will require additional resources for management and setup, so it's complex to implement. Also, you may end up losing data when a container from the unit becomes unserviceable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"6thirdpartyloggingservices\">6. Third-party Logging Services</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of third-party logging services you can use according to your infrastructure and application needs, enabling you to aggregate, manage, and analyze logs and take proactive preventative actions as a result.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.splunk.com/\">Splunk</a>:</strong> Splunk is built to scale from a single server to multiple data centers. It has built-in alerting and reporting, real-time search, analysis, and visualization, which helps you take action against malfunctions faster. It comes with a Splunk Enterprise on-premise deployment and Splunk Cloud. The free plan comes with 500 MB data per day, and the paid plan starts from $150 a month for a GB.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/logstash\">Logstash</a>:</strong> Logstash is part of the <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/products\">Elastic Stack</a> along with Beats, Elasticsearch, and Kibana. It's a server-side data processing pipeline that ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then sends it to your favourite &quot;stash.&quot; Logstash has over 200 plugins for input, filter/transform, and output. It's free and open source.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.fluentd.org/\">Fluentd</a>:</strong> Fluentd is an open-source data collector. Its performance has been well proven, handling 5 TB of daily data, 50,000 messages/sec at peak time. The main reason to use it would be performance. It's free and open source.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.papertrail.com/\">PaperTrail</a>:</strong> PaperTrail is a simple and user-friendly service that provides a terminal-like experience. Once the data is sent over the syslog, you can perform tail and search operations with the PaperTrail UI. It's affordable for low volumes but becomes expensive for higher volume. It comes with a free 50 MB/month plan, and paid plans start at $7/month for 1 GB per month.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.loggly.com/\">Loggly</a>:</strong> Loggly focuses on simplicity and ease of use for a DevOps audience. It's one of the more robust log analyzers. Primary use cases are for troubleshooting and customer support scenarios, and it provides richer visualizations and more parsing functionality than PaperTrail. It comes with a free 200 MB/day, and paid plans start at $79 a month for 1 GB per day ingestion with a 2 weeks retention.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"limitationsandchallengesofdockerlogging\">Limitations and Challenges of Docker Logging</h2>\n<p>Docker makes containerized application deployment easier, faster, and streamlines it with limited resources. Log management and analysis are handled differently with Docker as compared to a traditional system, which introduces a new set of challenges and limitations. From storing logs in a file system to forwarding them to a central repository, Docker logging has some pain points you'll need to overcome with a deeper understanding of Docker capability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"theonlycompatibledriverisjsonfile\">The Only Compatible Driver Is json-file</h3>\n<p>The json-file driver is the only one that works with the <code>docker logs</code> command, a limitation of Docker logs. When you start using any other logging drivers, such as Fluentd or Splunk, the <code>docker logs</code> command shows an error and the Docker logs API calls will fail. Also, you won't be able to check the container logs in this situation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dockersyslogimpactscontainerdeployment\">Docker Syslog Impacts Container Deployment</h3>\n<p>The reliable way to deliver logs is via Docker Syslog with TCP or TLS. But this driver needs an established TCP connection to the Syslog server whenever a container starts up. And the container will fail ife a connection is not made.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">$ docker: Error response from daemon: Failed to initialize logging driver: dial tcp\n</code></pre>\n<p>Your container deployment will be affected if you face network problems or latency issues. And it's not recommended that you restart the Syslog server because this will drop all the connections from the containers to a central Syslog server.</p>\n<h3 id=\"potentiallossoflogswithdockersyslogdriver\">Potential Loss of Logs with Docker Syslog Driver</h3>\n<p>The Docker syslog driver needs an established TCP or TLS connection to deliver logs. Note that when the connection is down or not reachable, you'll start losing the logs until the connection reestablished.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multilinelogsnotsupported\">Multiline Logs Not Supported</h3>\n<p>Generally, either of two patterns is followed for logging: single-line per log or multiple lines with extended information per log, like stack traces or exceptions. But with Docker logging, this is a moot point, because containers always broadcast logs to the same output: <code>stdout</code>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"multipleloggingdriversnotsupported\">Multiple Logging Drivers Not Supported</h3>\n<p>It's mandatory that you use only a single driver for all of your logging needs. Scenarios where you can store logs locally and push it to remote servers are not supported.</p>\n<h3 id=\"logscanmissorskip\">Logs Can Miss or Skip</h3>\n<p>There's a rate limitation setting at the Docker end for journald drivers that takes care of the rate that logs get pushed. If it exceeds, then the driver might skip some logs. To prevent such issues, increase the rate limitation settings according to your logging needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>While Docker containerization allows developers to encapsulate a program and its file system into a single portable package, that certainly doesn't mean containerization is free of maintenance. Docker Logging is a bit more complex than traditional methods, so teams using Docker must familiarize themselves with the Docker logging to support full-stack visibility, troubleshooting, performance improvements, root cause analysis, etc.</p>\n<p>As we have seen in this post, to facilitate logging, Docker offers logging drivers and commands in the platform which gives you the mechanisms for accessing the performance data and also provides plugins to integrate with third-party logging tools as well. To maximize the logging capabilities there are several methods and strategies which help in designing your logging infrastructure, but each comes with its advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>With this understanding of logging, containerization can be a powerful tool.

Once you've deployed your application, logging is one of\nthe best tools to help reveal errors, aid in debugging, and optimize your\napplication's performance.\n\nWith that in mind, let's dive into Docker logging and its log files.\n\nIntroduction to Docker Logging\nDevelopers, DevOps professionals, and product stakeholders all apply knowledge\ngained from logging to improve a system's performance and reliability. Much of\nwhat an application, server, or OS does should be recorded in the logs and\naggregated in an easily accessible location. A log analysis\n[https://www.sumologic.com/glossary/log-analysis/] then uses all the log events\nand audit trails to help chalk out a clear picture of events that happen across\nyour application.\n\nIn Docker [https://www.docker.com/], containers are isolated and bundled with\nsoftware, libraries, and configuration files. In a traditional single-server\nsetup log analysis is centralized on a single node, but with a stateless\ncontainerized setup logging becomes more complex. Why? Two reasons:\n\n1. Containers are transient. When a Docker container broadcasts logs, it sends\nthem to the application's stdout and stderr output streams. The underlying\ncontainer logging driver can start accessing these streams, and the logs are\nstored on the Docker host in JSON files (json-file is the default logging driver\nused by Docker [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/]).\nIt writes JSON-formatted logs to a file on the host where the container is\nrunning. Any logs stored in the container will be deleted when it is terminated\nor shut down.\n\n2. Containers are multileveled. There are two levels of aggregation in Docker\nlogging. One refers to the logs from inside the container in your Dockerized\napplication, and the second refers to the logs from the host servers (eg, system\nlogs, Docker daemon logs), which are generally located in /var/log. A log\naggregator that has access to the host pulls application log files and accesses\nthe file system inside the container to collect the logs. Later, you'd need to\ncorrelate these log events for analysis.\n\nIn this article, you'll learn about different logging strategies you can use in\na Dockerized application—how you can access logs and understand Docker logging\ncommands, drivers, configuration, and management to build a highly performant\nand reliable infrastructure.\n\nDocker Logging Commands\ndocker logs is a command that shows all the information logged by a running\ncontainer. The docker service logs command shows information logged by all the\ncontainers participating in a service. By default, the output of these commands,\nas it would appear if you run the command in a terminal, opens up three I/O\nstreams: STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR. And the default is set to show only STDOUT\nand STDERR.\n\n * STDIN is the command's input stream, which may include input from the\n   keyboard or input from another command.\n * STDOUT is usually a command's normal output.\n * STDERR is typically used to output error messages.\n\nThe docker logs command may not be useful in cases when a logging driver is\nconfigured to send logs to a file, database, or an external host/backend, or if\nthe image is configured to send logs to a file instead of STDOUT and STDERR.\nWith docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>, you can see all the logs broadcasted by a\nspecific container identified by a unique ID.\n\n$ docker run --name test -d busybox sh -c \"while true; do $(echo date); sleep 1; done\"\n$ date\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 UTC\n$ docker logs -f --until=2s test\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:00 UTC\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:01 UTC\nTue 06 Feb 2020 00:00:02 UTC\n\n\ndocker logs works a bit differently in community and enterprise versions. In\nDocker Enterprise, docker logs read logs created by any logging driver, but in\nDocker CE, it can only read logs created by the json-file, local, and journald\ndrivers.\n\nFor example, here's the JSON log created by the hello-world\n[https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world] Docker image using the json-file driver:\n\n$ {\"log\":\"Hello from Docker!\\n\",\"stream\":\"stdout\",\"time\":\"2021-02-10T00:00:00.000000000Z\"}\n\n\nAs you can see, the log follows a pattern of printing:\n\n * Log's origin\n * Either stdout or stderr\n * A timestamp\n\nYou can find this log in your Docker host at:\n\n$ /var/lib/docker/containers/<container id>/<container id>-json.log  \n\n\nThese Docker logs are stored in a host container and will build up over time. To\naddress that, you can implement log rotation, which will remove a chunk of logs\nat specified intervals, and a log aggregator, which can be used to push them\ninto a centralized location for a permanent log repository. You can use this\nrepository for further analysis and improvements in the system down the road.\n\nTo find container_id, run the docker ps command. It'll list all the running\ncontainers.\n\n$ docker ps\nCONTAINER ID   IMAGE       COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS     NAMES\ncg95e1yqk810   bar_image  \"node index.js\"     Y min ago           Up Y min            80/tcp     bar_app\n\n\nThen, the docker logs container_id lists the logs for a particular container.\n\n$ docker logs <container_id>\n\n\nIf you want to follow the Docker container logs:\n\n$ docker logs <container_id> -f\n\n\nIf you want to see the last N log lines:\n\n$ docker logs <container_id> --tail N\n\n\nIf you only want to see any specific logs, use grep:\n\n$ docker logs <container_id> | grep node\n\n\nIf you want to check errors:\n\n$ docker logs <container_id> | grep -i error\n\n\nLogging Drivers Supported by Docker\nLogging drivers, or log-drivers, are mechanisms for getting information from\nrunning containers and services, and Docker has lots of them available for you.\nEvery Docker daemon has a default logging driver, which each container uses.\nDocker uses the json-file logging driver as its default driver.\n\nCurrently, Docker supports the following logging drivers:\n\nDriverDescriptionnoneNo logs are available for the container and Docker logs do\nnot return any output.local\n[https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/local/]Logs are stored in a\ncustom format designed for minimal overhead.json-file\n[https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/json-file/]Logs are formatted\nas JSON.

Only available on Windows platforms.\nlogentries [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/logentries/]Writes\nlog messages to Rapid7 Logentries.Configuring the Logging Driver\nTo configure the Docker daemon to a logging driver, you need to set the value of \nlog-driver to the name of the logging driver in the daemon.json configuration\nfile. Then you need to restart Docker for the changes to take effect for all the\nnewly created containers. All the existing containers will remain as they are.\n\nFor example, let's set up a default logging driver with some additional options.\n\n{\n  \"log-driver\": \"json-file\",\n  \"log-opts\": {\n    \"max-size\": \"25m\",\n    \"max-file\": \"10\",\n    \"labels\": \"production_bind\",\n    \"env\": \"os,customer\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nTo find the current logging driver for the Docker daemon:\n\n$ docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'\n\njson-file\n\n\nYou can override the default driver by adding the --log-driver option to the\ndocker run command that creates a container.\n\nThe following command will start using the Splunk driver:\n\ndocker run --log-driver splunk httpd\n\n\nModify the daemon.json file, to pass the address of the splunk host to the\ndriver:\n\n{\n    \"log-driver\": \"splunk\",\n    \"log-opts\": {\n        \"splunk-url\": \"172.1.1.1:11111\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n$ docker inspect -f '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}' <CONTAINER>\n\nsplunk\n\n\nChoosing the Delivery Mode of Log Messages From Container to Log Driver\nDocker provides two modes for delivering log messages:\n\n * Blocking (default): The container interrupts the application every time it\n   needs to deliver a message to the driver. This will add latency in the\n   performance of your application (for some drivers), but it'll guarantee that\n   all the messages will be sent to the driver. Case in point, the json-file\n   driver writes logs very quickly, therefore it's unlikely to cause latency.\n   But drivers like gcplogs and awslogs open a connection to a remote server and\n   so are more likely to block and cause latency.\n   \n   \n * Non-Blocking: The container writes and stores its logs to an in-memory ring\n   buffer until the logging driver is available to process them. This ensures\n   that a high rate of logging will not affect application performance. It does\n   not guarantee that all the messages will be sent to the driver. In cases\n   where log broadcasts are faster than the driver processor, the ring buffer\n   will soon run out of space. As a result, buffered logs are deleted to make\n   space for the next set of incoming logs. The default value for \n   max-buffer-size is 1 MB.\n   \n   \n\nTo change the mode:\n\n{\n    \"log-driver\": \"splunk\",\n    \"log-opts\": {\n        \"splunk-url\": \"172.1.1.1:11111\",\n        \"mode\": \"non-blocking\"\n    }\n}\n\n\nUnderstanding Logging Strategies\nDocker logging effectively means logging the events of an application, host OS,\nand the respective Docker service. There are a few defined logging strategies\nyou should keep in mind when working with containerized apps.\n\n1. Application Logging\nIn this logging strategy, the application running in the containers will have\nits own logging framework. For example, a Node.js app could use a winston\n[https://www.npmjs.com/package/winston] library to format and send the logs.\nWith this approach, you have complete control over the logging event.\n\nIf you have multiple containers, you need to add an identifier at each container\nlevel, so you can uniquely determine the container and its respective logs. But\nas the size of the logs increases, this will start creating a load on the\napplication process. Due to the transient nature of containers, the logs will be\nwiped out when a container is terminated or shut down.\n\nTo address this, you have two options:\n\n * Configure steady storage to hold these logs, i.e. disks/data volumes.\n * Forward these logs to a log management solution.\n\n2. Data Volumes\nIn this logging strategy, your container's directory gets links to one of the\nhost machine directories that will hold all the data for you. Containers can now\nbe terminated or shut down, and access logs from multiple containers.\n\nA regular backup is a good idea in order to prevent data corruption or loss in\ncase of a failure. But if you want to shift the containers on different hosts\nwithout loss of data, then the data volumes strategy will make that difficult.\n\n3. Docker Logging Driver\nDocker has a bunch of logging drivers that can be used in your logging strategy.\nThe configured driver reads the data broadcast by the container's stdout or \nstderr streams and writes it to a file on the host machine. By default, the host\nmachine holds the log files, but you can forward these events using the\navailable drivers, like fluentd, Splunk, and awslogs.\n\nNote that the docker log command will not work if you use anything other than\nthe json-file driver. And if log forwarding over a TCP connection fails or\nbecomes unreachable, the containers will shut down.\n\n4. Dedicated Logging Container\nHere, you need to set up a dedicated container whose only job is to collect and\nmanage logs within a Docker ecosystem. It'll aggregate, monitor, and analyze\nlogs from containers and forward them to a central repository. The log\ndependency on the host machine is no longer an issue, and it's best suited for\nmicroservices architecture.\n\nThis strategy gives you the freedom to:\n\n * Move containers between the hosts.\n * Scale up by just adding a new container.\n * Tie up all the various streams of log events.\n\n5. Sidecar Logging Container\nThis logging strategy is similar to dedicated logging in that you have a\ncontainer to hold logs, but here, each application has its own dedicated logging\ncontainer (note that the application and its log container can be considered as\na single unit). This opens up the flexibility of app-level logging\ncustomization. By adding custom identifiers, you can identify the specific\ncontainer that broadcasts the log.\n\nThis is best suited for a complex system where each entity customizes the logs,\nmaking it popular in microservices deployment. Maintaining a container per\napplication level will require additional resources for management and setup, so\nit's complex to implement. Also, you may end up losing data when a container\nfrom the unit becomes unserviceable.\n\n6. Third-party Logging Services\nThere are a lot of third-party logging services you can use according to your\ninfrastructure and application needs, enabling you to aggregate, manage, and\nanalyze logs and take proactive preventative actions as a result.\n\n * Splunk [http://www.splunk.com/]: Splunk is built to scale from a single\n   server to multiple data centers. It has built-in alerting and reporting,\n   real-time search, analysis, and visualization, which helps you take action\n   against malfunctions faster. It comes with a Splunk Enterprise on-premise\n   deployment and Splunk Cloud. The free plan comes with 500 MB data per day,\n   and the paid plan starts from $150 a month for a GB.\n * Logstash [https://github.com/elastic/logstash]: Logstash is part of the \n   Elastic Stack [https://www.elastic.co/products] along with Beats,\n   Elasticsearch, and Kibana. It's a server-side data processing pipeline that\n   ingests data from a multitude of sources simultaneously, transforms it, and\n   then sends it to your favourite \"stash.\" Logstash has over 200 plugins for\n   input, filter/transform, and output. It's free and open source.\n * Fluentd [http://www.fluentd.org/]: Fluentd is an open-source data collector.\n   Its performance has been well proven, handling 5 TB of daily data, 50,000\n   messages/sec at peak time. The main reason to use it would be performance.\n   It's free and open source.\n * PaperTrail [https://www.papertrail.com/]: PaperTrail is a simple and\n   user-friendly service that provides a terminal-like experience. Once the data\n   is sent over the syslog, you can perform tail and search operations with the\n   PaperTrail UI. It's affordable for low volumes but becomes expensive for\n   higher volume. It comes with a free 50 MB/month plan, and paid plans start at\n   $7/month for 1 GB per month.\n * Loggly [https://www.loggly.com/]: Loggly focuses on simplicity and ease of\n   use for a DevOps audience. It's one of the more robust log analyzers. Primary\n   use cases are for troubleshooting and customer support scenarios, and it\n   provides richer visualizations and more parsing functionality than\n   PaperTrail. It comes with a free 200 MB/day, and paid plans start at $79 a\n   month for 1 GB per day ingestion with a 2 weeks retention.\n\nLimitations and Challenges of Docker Logging\nDocker makes containerized application deployment easier, faster, and\nstreamlines it with limited resources. Log management and analysis are handled\ndifferently with Docker as compared to a traditional system, which introduces a\nnew set of challenges and limitations. From storing logs in a file system to\nforwarding them to a central repository, Docker logging has some pain points\nyou'll need to overcome with a deeper understanding of Docker capability.\n\nThe Only Compatible Driver Is json-file\nThe json-file driver is the only one that works with the docker logs command, a\nlimitation of Docker logs. When you start using any other logging drivers, such\nas Fluentd or Splunk, the docker logs command shows an error and the Docker logs\nAPI calls will fail. Also, you won't be able to check the container logs in this\nsituation.\n\nDocker Syslog Impacts Container Deployment\nThe reliable way to deliver logs is via Docker Syslog with TCP or TLS. But this\ndriver needs an established TCP connection to the Syslog server whenever a\ncontainer starts up. And the container will fail ife a connection is not made.\n\n$ docker: Error response from daemon: Failed to initialize logging driver: dial tcp\n\n\nYour container deployment will be affected if you face network problems or\nlatency issues. And it's not recommended that you restart the Syslog server\nbecause this will drop all the connections from the containers to a central\nSyslog server.\n\nPotential Loss of Logs with Docker Syslog Driver\nThe Docker syslog driver needs an established TCP or TLS connection to deliver\nlogs. Note that when the connection is down or not reachable, you'll start\nlosing the logs until the connection reestablished.\n\nMultiline Logs Not Supported\nGenerally, either of two patterns is followed for logging: single-line per log\nor multiple lines with extended information per log, like stack traces or\nexceptions. But with Docker logging, this is a moot point, because containers\nalways broadcast logs to the same output: stdout.\n\nMultiple Logging Drivers Not Supported\nIt's mandatory that you use only a single driver for all of your logging needs.\nScenarios where you can store logs locally and push it to remote servers are not\nsupported.\n\nLogs Can Miss or Skip\nThere's a rate limitation setting at the Docker end for journald drivers that\ntakes care of the rate that logs get pushed. If it exceeds, then the driver\nmight skip some logs. To prevent such issues, increase the rate limitation\nsettings according to your logging needs.\n\nConclusion\nWhile Docker containerization allows developers to encapsulate a program and its\nfile system into a single portable package, that certainly doesn't mean\ncontainerization is free of maintenance. Docker Logging is a bit more complex\nthan traditional methods, so teams using Docker must familiarize themselves with\nthe Docker logging to support full-stack visibility, troubleshooting,\nperformance improvements, root cause analysis, etc.\n\nAs we have seen in this post, to facilitate logging, Docker offers logging\ndrivers and commands in the platform which gives you the mechanisms for\naccessing the performance data and also provides plugins to integrate with\nthird-party logging tools as well. To maximize the logging capabilities there\nare several methods and strategies which help in designing your logging\ninfrastructure, but each comes with its advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWith this understanding of logging, containerization can be a powerful tool.\nEarthly is a containerized continuous integration tool [http://earthly.dev/].

Usually, from a series of statements like `RUN`, `FROM`, and `COPY`, which are put into a Dockerfile and built.  But how are those commands turned into a container image and then a running container?  We can build up an intuition for how this works by understanding the phases involved and creating a container image ourselves. We will create an image programmatically and then develop a trivial syntactic frontend and use it to build an image.\\n\\n### Game Plan:\\n-  ☑️ Intro\\n-  ☐️ Background\\n-  ☐ Understanding Compiler Stages and BuildKit\\n-  ☐ Programmatically Creating an Image\\n-  ☐ Building a Frontend for BuildKit\\n\\n## On `Docker Build`\\n\\nWe can create container images in several ways. We can use Buildpacks, we can use build tools like Bazel or sbt, but by far, the most common way images are built is using `docker build` with a Dockerfile.  The familiar base images Alpine, Ubuntu, and Debian are all created this way.     \\n\\nHere is an example Dockerfile:\\n```\\nFROM alpine\\nCOPY README.md README.md\\nRUN echo \\\"standard docker build\\\" > /built.txt\\\"\\n```\\nWe will be using variations on this Dockerfile throughout this tutorial. \\n\\nWe can build it like this:\\n```\\ndocker build . -t test\\n```\\n\\nBut what is happening when you call `docker build`? To understand that, we will need a little background.\\n\\n# Background\\n A docker image is made up of layers. Those layers form an immutable filesystem.  A container image also has some descriptive data, such as the start-up command, the ports to expose, and volumes to mount. When you `docker run` an image, it starts up inside a container runtime.\\n \\n I like to think about images and containers by analogy. If an image is like an executable, then a container is like a process. You can run multiple containers from one image, and a running image isn't an image at all but a container.  \\n\\n ![An image is like an executable](/content/images/2021/03/1-2.png)\\n\\nContinuing our analogy, [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) is a compiler, just like [LLVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM).  But whereas a compiler takes source code and libraries and produces an executable, BuildKit takes a Dockerfile and a file path and creates a container image. \\n\\n![BuildKit is like a compiler for Docker images]![buildctl](/content/images/2021/03/buildctl.png)\\n\\n\\nDocker build uses BuildKit, to turn a Dockerfile into a docker image, OCI image, or another image format.  In this walk-through, we will primarily use BuildKit directly.  \\n\\n![Docker Daemon with BuildKit Daemon inside it](/content/images/2021/03/buildctl-2.png)\\n\\nThis [primer on using buildkit](/what-is-buildkit-and-what-can-i-do-with-it/) supplies some helpful background on using BuildKit, `buildkitd`, and `buildctl` via the command-line. However, the only prerequisite for today is running `brew install buildkit` or the appropriate OS [equivalent](https://github.com/moby/buildkit#quick-start) steps.\\n\\n\\n## How Do Compilers Work?\\nA traditional compiler takes code in a high-level language and lowers it to a lower-level language.  In most conventional ahead-of-time compilers, the final target is machine code. Machine code is a low-level programming language that your CPU understands[^1].  \\n\\n| ℹ️ Fun Fact: Machine Code VS. Assembly       |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| Machine code is written in binary. This makes it hard for a human to understand.  Assembly code is a plain-text representation of machine code that is designed to be somewhat human-readable. There is generally a 1-1 mapping between instructions the machine understands (in machine code) and the OpCodes in Assembly  |\\n\\n\\nCompiling the classic c \\\"Hello, World\\\" into x86 assembly code using the CLANG frontend for LLVM looks like this:\\n\\n![Compiling Hello World to X86 assembly](/content/images/2021/03/compilingc.png)\\n\\nCreating an image from a dockerfile works a similar way:\\n\\n![Compiling Docker Image](/content/images/2021/03/build-an-image.png)\\n\\nBuildKit is passed the Dockerfile and the build context, which is the present working directory in the above diagram. In simplified terms, each line in the dockerfile is turned into a layer in the resulting image.  One significant way image building differs from compiling is this build context.  A compiler's input is limited to source code, whereas `docker build` takes a reference to the host filesystem as an input and uses it to perform actions such as `COPY`.\\n\\n## There Is a Catch\\nThe earlier diagram of compiling \\\"Hello, World\\\" in a single step missed a vital detail. Computer hardware is not a singular thing. If every compiler were a hand-coded mapping from a high-level language to x86 machine code, then moving to the Apple M1 processor would be quite challenging because it has a different instruction set.  \\n\\nCompiler authors have overcome this challenge by splitting compilation into phases.  The traditional phases are the frontend, the backend, and the middle. The middle phase is sometimes called the optimizer, and it deals primarily with an internal representation (IR).\\n\\n\\n![Three stage build process](/content/images/2021/03/3stagebuild.png)\\n\\nThis staged approach means you don't need a new compiler for each new machine architecture.  Instead, you just need a new backend. Here is an example of what that looks like in [LLVM](https://llvm.org/):\\n\\n\\n![Backends of LLVM](/content/images/2021/03/backends.png)\\n \\n## Intermediate Representations\\nThis multiple backend approach allows LLVM to target ARM, X86, and many other machine architectures using LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) as a standard protocol.  LLVM IR is a human-readable programming language that backends need to be able to take as input. To create a new backend, you need to write a translator from LLVM IR to your target machine code. That translation is the primary job of each backend.\\n\\nOnce you have this IR, you have a protocol that various phases of the compiler can use as an interface, and you can build not just many backends but many frontends as well. LLVM has frontends for numerous languages, including C++, Julia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift.  \\n\\n![One compiler, with many frontend and backends](/content/images/2021/03/frontends-2.png)\\n\\nIf you can write a translation from your language to LLVM IR, LLVM can translate that IR into machine code for all the backends it supports. This translation function is the primary job of a compiler frontend.\\n \\n In practice, there is much more to it than that. Frontends need to tokenize and parse input files, and they need to return pleasant errors. Backends often have target-specific optimizations to perform and heuristics to apply. But for this tutorial, the critical point is that having a standard representation ends up being a bridge that connects many front ends with many backends. This shared interface removes the need to create a compiler for every combination of language and machine architecture. It is a simple but very empowering trick!\\n\\n\\n## BuidKit\\nImages, unlike executables, have their own isolated filesystem. Nevertheless, the task of building an image looks very similar to compiling an executable. They can have varying syntax (dockerfile1.0, dockerfile1.2), and the result must target several machine architectures (arm64 vs. x86_64).\\n\\n> \\\"LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C\\\" - [BuildKit Readme](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/README.md)\\n\\nThis similarity was not lost on the BuildKit creators.  BuildKit has its own intermediate representation, LLB.  And where LLVM IR has things like function calls and garbage-collection strategies, LLB has mounting filesystems and executing statements.\\n\\n![LLVM IR VS. LLB](/content/images/2021/03/LLB-IR.png)\\n\\n[LLB](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/ebd98bcbe600c662a72ce9725417540f277be4d6/solver/pb/ops.proto) is defined as a protocol buffer, and this means that BuildKit frontends can make GRPC requests against buildkitd to build a container directly.\\n\\n![LLVM IR VS. LLB](/content/images/2021/03/Send-LLB.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Programmatically Making An Image\\nAlright, enough background.  Let's programmatically generate the LLB for an image and then build an image.  \\n\\n| ℹ️ Using Go      |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| In this example, we will be using Go which lets us leverage existing BuildKit libraries, but it's possible to accomplish this in any language with Protocol Buffer support. |\\n\\n\\nImport LLB defintions:\\n```\\nimport (\\n\\t\\\"github.com/moby/buildkit/client/llb\\\"\\n)\\n```\\n\\nCreate LLB for an Alpine image:\\n```\\nfunc createLLBState() llb.State {\\n\\treturn llb.Image(\\\"docker.io/library/alpine\\\").\\n\\t\\tFile(llb.Copy(llb.Local(\\\"context\\\"), \\\"README.md\\\", \\\"README.md\\\")).\\n\\t\\tRun(llb.Args([]string{\\\"/bin/sh\\\", \\\"-c\\\", \\\"echo \\\\\\\"programmatically built\\\\\\\" > /built.txt\\\"})).\\n    Root()\\n}\\n\\n```\\nWe are accomplishing the equivalent of a `FROM` by using `llb.Image`. Then, we copy a file from the local file system into the image using `File` and `Copy`.  Finally, we `RUN` a command to echo some text to a file.  LLB has many more operations, but you can recreate many standard images with these three building blocks.\\n\\nThe final thing we need to do is turn this into protocol-buffer and emit it to standard out:\\n\\n```\\nfunc main() {\\n\\n\\tdt, err := createLLBState().Marshal(context.TODO(), llb.LinuxAmd64)\\n\\tif err != nil {\\n\\t\\tpanic(err)\\n\\t}\\n\\tllb.WriteTo(dt, os.Stdout)\\n}\\n```\\nLet's look at the what this generates using the `dump-llb` option of buildctl:\\n```\\n go run ./writellb/writellb.go | \\\\\\n buildctl debug dump-llb | \\\\\\n jq .\\n\\n```\\nWe get this JSON formatted LLB:\\n```\\n{\\n  \\\"Op\\\": {\\n    \\\"Op\\\": {\\n      \\\"source\\\": {\\n        \\\"identifier\\\": \\\"local://context\\\",\\n        \\\"attrs\\\":

\\\"attrs\\\": {\\n          \\\"local.unique\\\": \\\"s43w96rwjsm9tf1zlxvn6nezg\\\"\\n        }\\n      }\\n```\\nSimilarly, the output contains LLB that corresponds to our  `RUN` and `FROM` commands. \\n\\n### Building Our LLB\\n\\nTo build our image, we must first start `buildkitd`:\\n\\n```\\ndocker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit\\nexport BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit\\n```\\nWe can then build our image like this:\\n```\\ngo run ./writellb/writellb.go | \\\\\\nbuildctl build \\\\\\n--local context=. \\\\\\n--output type=image,name=docker.io/agbell/test,push=true\\n```\\nThe output flag lets us specify what backend we want BuildKit to use.  We will ask it to build an OCI image and push it to docker.io. \\n\\n| ℹ️ Real-World Usage     |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| In the real-world tool, we might want to programmatically make sure `buildkitd` is running and send the RPC request directly to it, as well as provide friendly error messages. For tutorial purposes, we will skip all that. |\\n\\n\\nWe can run it like this:\\n\\n```\\n> docker run -it --pull always agbell/test:latest /bin/sh\\n\\n```\\nAnd we can then see the results of our programmatic `COPY` and `RUN` commands:\\n```\\n/ # cat built.txt \\nprogrammatically built\\n/ # ls README.md\\nREADME.md\\n```\\n\\nThere we go! The [full code example](https://github.com/agbell/compiling-containers/blob/main/writellb/writellb.go) can be a great starting place for your own programmatic docker image building.   \\n\\n## A True Frontend for BuildKit\\n\\nA true compiler front end does more than just emit hardcoded IR.  A proper frontend takes in files, tokenizes them, parses them, generates a syntax tree, and then lowers that syntax tree into the internal representation.  [Mockerfiles](https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend/) are an example of such a frontend:\\n```\\n#syntax=r2d4/mocker\\napiVersion: v1alpha1\\nimages:\\n- name: demo\\n  from: ubuntu:16.04\\n  package:\\n    install:\\n    - curl\\n    - git\\n    - gcc\\n``` \\n\\nAnd because Docker build supports the `#syntax` command we can even build a Mockerfiles directly with `docker build`. \\n```\\ndocker build -f mockerfile.yaml\\n```\\n\\nTo support the #syntax command, all that is needed is to put the frontend in a docker image that accepts a GRPC request in the correct format, publish that image somewhere.  At that point, anyone can use your frontend `docker build` by just using `#syntax=yourimagename`.\\n\\n## Building Our Own Example Frontend for `Docker build`\\n\\nBuilding a tokenizer and a parser as a GRPC service is beyond the scope of this article. But we can get our feet wet by extracting and modifying an existing frontend. The standard [dockerfile frontend](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/tree/master/frontend/dockerfile) is easy to disentangle from the moby project.  I've pulled the relevant parts out into a [stand-alone repo](https://github.com/agbell/compiling-containers/tree/main/ickfile).  Let's make some trivial modifications to it and test it out.\\n\\nSo far, we've only used the docker commands `FROM`, `RUN` and `COPY`.  At a surface level, with its capitalized commands, Dockerfile syntax looks a lot like the programming language [INTERCAL](/intercal-yaml-and-other-horrible-programming-languages/). Let change these commands to their INTERCAL equivalent and develop our own Ickfile format [^2].\\n\\n| Dockerfile        | Ickfile           |\\n| ------------- |:-------------:| \\n| FROM          | COME FROM | \\n| RUN           | PLEASE        | \\n| COPY          | STASH      | \\n\\n\\nThe modules in the dockerfile frontend split the parsing of the input file into several discreet steps, with execution flowing this way:\\n\\n![ControlFlow from main.go to Dockerfile2LLB to Parser to Command.go](./bk-internals-images/controlflow.png)\\n\\nFor this tutorial, we are only going to make trivial changes to the frontend.  We will leave all the stages intact and focus on customizing the existing commands to our tastes.  To do this, all we need to do is change `command.go`:\\n\\n```\\npackage command\\n\\n// Define constants for the command strings\\nconst (\\n\\tCopy        = \\\"stash\\\"\\n\\tRun         = \\\"please\\\"\\n\\tFrom        = \\\"come_from\\\"\\n\\t...\\n)\\n```\\n\\nThen we build our image:\\n```\\ndocker build . -t agbell/ick\\n```\\n\\nAnd we can use this image as a BuildKit frontend and build images with it like this:\\n```\\n#syntax=agbell/ick\\nCOME_FROM alpine\\nSTASH README.md README.md\\nPLEASE echo \\\"custom frontend built\\\" > /built.txt\\\"\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f ./Ickfile -t ick \\n```\\n\\nAnd we can run it just like any other image:\\n```\\n> docker run -it ick /bin/sh\\n```\\nAnd we can then see results of our `STASH` and `PLEASE` commands:\\n```\\n/ # cat built.txt \\ncustom frontend built\\n/ # ls README.md\\nREADME.md\\n```\\nI've pushed this image to dockerhub.  Anyone can start building images using our `ickfile` format by adding `#syntax=agbell/ick` to an existing Dockerfile. No manual installation is required!\\n\\n| ℹ️ Enabling BuildKit      |\\n|-----------------------------------|\\n| BuildKit is included but not enabled by default in the current version of Docker (`version 20.10.2`). To instruct `docker build` to use BuildKit set the following environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`. This will not be necessary once BuildKit reaches general availability.  |\\n\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nWe have learned that a three-phased structure borrowed from compilers powers building images, that an intermediate representation called LLB is the key to that structure.  Empowered by the knowledge, we have produced two frontends for building images.  \\n\\n\\nThis deep dive on frontends still leaves much to explore.  If you want to learn more, I suggest looking into BuildKit workers.  Workers do the actual building and are the secret behind `docker buildx`, and [multi-archtecture builds](https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/). `docker build` also has support for remote workers and cache mounts, both of which can lead to faster builds.\\n\\n[Earthly](http://earthly.dev/) uses BuildKit internally for its repeatable build syntax. Without it, our containerized Makefile-like syntax would not be possible. If you want a saner CI process, then [you should check it out](http://earthly.dev/).\\n\\nThere is also much more to explore about how modern compilers work. Modern compilers often have many stages and more than one intermediate representation, and they are often able to do very sophisticated optimizations.[^3]\\n\\n[^1]: Fun Fact: You may have heard the term transpiler or transcompiler in the past. Transpilers are compilers that transform one programming language into another. If all compilers translate from one language to another, then what makes something a transpiler?\\n\\n    The difference between the two is murky, but I like to think of a transpiler as something that translates from one human-readable text-based programming language to another. The java compiler translates Java code to java byte code, which is a binary format.  Meanwhile, PureScript, which translates to JavaScript, is regarded as a transpiler because JavaScript is text-based.\\n\\n[^2]: Ick is the name of the INTERCAL compiler. Therefore Ickfile can be its Dockerfile equivalent. \\n\\n[^3]: If you want to learn more about optimizing compilers, Matt Godbolt's article on [C++ Optimizations](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3372264) is a great place to start. The book [Building an Optimizing Compiler](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Optimizing-Compiler-Bob-Morgan/dp/155558179X) is also often recommended online.\"}]],\"markups\":[],\"sections\":[[10,0],[1,\"p\",[]]]}","html":"<!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h1 id=\"intro\">Intro</h1>\n<p>How are containers made?

We can use Buildpacks, we can use build tools like Bazel or sbt, but by far, the most common way images are built is using <code>docker build</code> with a Dockerfile.  The familiar base images Alpine, Ubuntu, and Debian are all created this way.</p>\n<p>Here is an example Dockerfile:</p>\n<pre><code>FROM alpine\nCOPY README.md README.md\nRUN echo &quot;standard docker build&quot; &gt; /built.txt&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>We will be using variations on this Dockerfile throughout this tutorial.</p>\n<p>We can build it like this:</p>\n<pre><code>docker build . -t test\n</code></pre>\n<p>But what is happening when you call <code>docker build</code>? To understand that, we will need a little background.</p>\n<h1 id=\"background\">Background</h1>\n<p>A docker image is made up of layers. Those layers form an immutable filesystem.  A container image also has some descriptive data, such as the start-up command, the ports to expose, and volumes to mount. When you <code>docker run</code> an image, it starts up inside a container runtime.</p>\n<p>I like to think about images and containers by analogy. If an image is like an executable, then a container is like a process. You can run multiple containers from one image, and a running image isn't an image at all but a container.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/1-2.png\" alt=\"An image is like an executable\"></p>\n<p>Continuing our analogy, <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/buildkit\">BuildKit</a> is a compiler, just like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM\">LLVM</a>.  But whereas a compiler takes source code and libraries and produces an executable, BuildKit takes a Dockerfile and a file path and creates a container image.</p>\n<p>![BuildKit is like a compiler for Docker images]<img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/buildctl.png\" alt=\"buildctl\"></p>\n<p>Docker build uses BuildKit, to turn a Dockerfile into a docker image, OCI image, or another image format.

In most conventional ahead-of-time compilers, the final target is machine code. Machine code is a low-level programming language that your CPU understands<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\">[1]</a></sup>.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>ℹ️ Fun Fact: Machine Code VS. Assembly</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Machine code is written in binary. This makes it hard for a human to understand.  Assembly code is a plain-text representation of machine code that is designed to be somewhat human-readable. There is generally a 1-1 mapping between instructions the machine understands (in machine code) and the OpCodes in Assembly</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Compiling the classic c &quot;Hello, World&quot; into x86 assembly code using the CLANG frontend for LLVM looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/compilingc.png\" alt=\"Compiling Hello World to X86 assembly\"></p>\n<p>Creating an image from a dockerfile works a similar way:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/build-an-image.png\" alt=\"Compiling Docker Image\"></p>\n<p>BuildKit is passed the Dockerfile and the build context, which is the present working directory in the above diagram. In simplified terms, each line in the dockerfile is turned into a layer in the resulting image.  One significant way image building differs from compiling is this build context.  A compiler's input is limited to source code, whereas <code>docker build</code> takes a reference to the host filesystem as an input and uses it to perform actions such as <code>COPY</code>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"thereisacatch\">There Is a Catch</h2>\n<p>The earlier diagram of compiling &quot;Hello, World&quot; in a single step missed a vital detail. Computer hardware is not a singular thing. If every compiler were a hand-coded mapping from a high-level language to x86 machine code, then moving to the Apple M1 processor would be quite challenging because it has a different instruction set.</p>\n<p>Compiler authors have overcome this challenge by splitting compilation into phases.  The traditional phases are the frontend, the backend, and the middle. The middle phase is sometimes called the optimizer, and it deals primarily with an internal representation (IR).</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/3stagebuild.png\" alt=\"Three stage build process\"></p>\n<p>This staged approach means you don't need a new compiler for each new machine architecture.  Instead, you just need a new backend. Here is an example of what that looks like in <a href=\"https://llvm.org/\">LLVM</a>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/backends.png\" alt=\"Backends of LLVM\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"intermediaterepresentations\">Intermediate Representations</h2>\n<p>This multiple backend approach allows LLVM to target ARM, X86, and many other machine architectures using LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) as a standard protocol.  LLVM IR is a human-readable programming language that backends need to be able to take as input. To create a new backend, you need to write a translator from LLVM IR to your target machine code. That translation is the primary job of each backend.</p>\n<p>Once you have this IR, you have a protocol that various phases of the compiler can use as an interface, and you can build not just many backends but many frontends as well. LLVM has frontends for numerous languages, including C++, Julia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/frontends-2.png\" alt=\"One compiler, with many frontend and backends\"></p>\n<p>If you can write a translation from your language to LLVM IR, LLVM can translate that IR into machine code for all the backends it supports. This translation function is the primary job of a compiler frontend.</p>\n<p>In practice, there is much more to it than that. Frontends need to tokenize and parse input files, and they need to return pleasant errors. Backends often have target-specific optimizations to perform and heuristics to apply. But for this tutorial, the critical point is that having a standard representation ends up being a bridge that connects many front ends with many backends. This shared interface removes the need to create a compiler for every combination of language and machine architecture. It is a simple but very empowering trick!</p>\n<h2 id=\"buidkit\">BuidKit</h2>\n<p>Images, unlike executables, have their own isolated filesystem. Nevertheless, the task of building an image looks very similar to compiling an executable. They can have varying syntax (dockerfile1.0, dockerfile1.2), and the result must target several machine architectures (arm64 vs. x86_64).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C&quot; - <a href=\"https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/README.md\">BuildKit Readme</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This similarity was not lost on the BuildKit creators.  BuildKit has its own intermediate representation, LLB.  And where LLVM IR has things like function calls and garbage-collection strategies, LLB has mounting filesystems and executing statements.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/content/images/2021/03/LLB-IR.png\" alt=\"LLVM IR VS.

A proper frontend takes in files, tokenizes them, parses them, generates a syntax tree, and then lowers that syntax tree into the internal representation.  <a href=\"https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend/\">Mockerfiles</a> are an example of such a frontend:</p>\n<pre><code>#syntax=r2d4/mocker\napiVersion: v1alpha1\nimages:\n- name: demo\n  from: ubuntu:16.04\n  package:\n    install:\n    - curl\n    - git\n    - gcc\n</code></pre>\n<p>And because Docker build supports the <code>#syntax</code> command we can even build a Mockerfiles directly with <code>docker build</code>.</p>\n<pre><code>docker build -f mockerfile.yaml\n</code></pre>\n<p>To support the #syntax command, all that is needed is to put the frontend in a docker image that accepts a GRPC request in the correct format, publish that image somewhere.

If you want to learn more, I suggest looking into BuildKit workers.  Workers do the actual building and are the secret behind <code>docker buildx</code>, and <a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/\">multi-archtecture builds</a>. <code>docker build</code> also has support for remote workers and cache mounts, both of which can lead to faster builds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://earthly.dev/\">Earthly</a> uses BuildKit internally for its repeatable build syntax.

Usually, from a series of statements like RUN, FROM,\nand COPY, which are put into a Dockerfile and built. But how are those commands\nturned into a container image and then a running container? We can build up an\nintuition for how this works by understanding the phases involved and creating a\ncontainer image ourselves. We will create an image programmatically and then\ndevelop a trivial syntactic frontend and use it to build an image.\n\nGame Plan:\n * ☑️ Intro\n * ☐️ Background\n * ☐ Understanding Compiler Stages and BuildKit\n * ☐ Programmatically Creating an Image\n * ☐ Building a Frontend for BuildKit\n\nOn Docker Build\nWe can create container images in several ways. We can use Buildpacks, we can\nuse build tools like Bazel or sbt, but by far, the most common way images are\nbuilt is using docker build with a Dockerfile. The familiar base images Alpine,\nUbuntu, and Debian are all created this way.\n\nHere is an example Dockerfile:\n\nFROM alpine\nCOPY README.md README.md\nRUN echo \"standard docker build\" > /built.txt\"\n\n\nWe will be using variations on this Dockerfile throughout this tutorial.\n\nWe can build it like this:\n\ndocker build . -t test\n\n\nBut what is happening when you call docker build? To understand that, we will\nneed a little background.\n\nBackground\nA docker image is made up of layers. Those layers form an immutable filesystem.\nA container image also has some descriptive data, such as the start-up command,\nthe ports to expose, and volumes to mount. When you docker run an image, it\nstarts up inside a container runtime.\n\nI like to think about images and containers by analogy. If an image is like an\nexecutable, then a container is like a process. You can run multiple containers\nfrom one image, and a running image isn't an image at all but a container.\n\n\n\nContinuing our analogy, BuildKit [https://github.com/moby/buildkit] is a\ncompiler, just like LLVM [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM]. But whereas a\ncompiler takes source code and libraries and produces an executable, BuildKit\ntakes a Dockerfile and a file path and creates a container image.\n\n![BuildKit is like a compiler for Docker images]\n\nDocker build uses BuildKit, to turn a Dockerfile into a docker image, OCI image,\nor another image format. In this walk-through, we will primarily use BuildKit\ndirectly.\n\n\n\nThis primer on using buildkit [/what-is-buildkit-and-what-can-i-do-with-it/] \nsupplies some helpful background on using BuildKit, buildkitd, and buildctl via\nthe command-line. However, the only prerequisite for today is running brew\ninstall buildkit or the appropriate OS equivalent\n[https://github.com/moby/buildkit#quick-start] steps.\n\nHow Do Compilers Work?\nA traditional compiler takes code in a high-level language and lowers it to a\nlower-level language. In most conventional ahead-of-time compilers, the final\ntarget is machine code. Machine code is a low-level programming language that\nyour CPU understands[1].\n\nℹ️ Fun Fact: Machine Code VS. AssemblyMachine code is written in binary. This\nmakes it hard for a human to understand. Assembly code is a plain-text\nrepresentation of machine code that is designed to be somewhat human-readable.\nThere is generally a 1-1 mapping between instructions the machine understands\n(in machine code) and the OpCodes in AssemblyCompiling the classic c \"Hello,\nWorld\" into x86 assembly code using the CLANG frontend for LLVM looks like this:\n\n\n\nCreating an image from a dockerfile works a similar way:\n\n\n\nBuildKit is passed the Dockerfile and the build context, which is the present\nworking directory in the above diagram. In simplified terms, each line in the\ndockerfile is turned into a layer in the resulting image. One significant way\nimage building differs from compiling is this build context. A compiler's input\nis limited to source code, whereas docker build takes a reference to the host\nfilesystem as an input and uses it to perform actions such as COPY.\n\nThere Is a Catch\nThe earlier diagram of compiling \"Hello, World\" in a single step missed a vital\ndetail. Computer hardware is not a singular thing. If every compiler were a\nhand-coded mapping from a high-level language to x86 machine code, then moving\nto the Apple M1 processor would be quite challenging because it has a different\ninstruction set.\n\nCompiler authors have overcome this challenge by splitting compilation into\nphases. The traditional phases are the frontend, the backend, and the middle.\nThe middle phase is sometimes called the optimizer, and it deals primarily with\nan internal representation (IR).\n\n\n\nThis staged approach means you don't need a new compiler for each new machine\narchitecture. Instead, you just need a new backend. Here is an example of what\nthat looks like in LLVM [https://llvm.org/]:\n\n\n\nIntermediate Representations\nThis multiple backend approach allows LLVM to target ARM, X86, and many other\nmachine architectures using LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) as a standard\nprotocol. LLVM IR is a human-readable programming language that backends need to\nbe able to take as input. To create a new backend, you need to write a\ntranslator from LLVM IR to your target machine code. That translation is the\nprimary job of each backend.\n\nOnce you have this IR, you have a protocol that various phases of the compiler\ncan use as an interface, and you can build not just many backends but many\nfrontends as well. LLVM has frontends for numerous languages, including C++,\nJulia, Objective-C, Rust, and Swift.\n\n\n\nIf you can write a translation from your language to LLVM IR, LLVM can translate\nthat IR into machine code for all the backends it supports. This translation\nfunction is the primary job of a compiler frontend.\n\nIn practice, there is much more to it than that. Frontends need to tokenize and\nparse input files, and they need to return pleasant errors. Backends often have\ntarget-specific optimizations to perform and heuristics to apply. But for this\ntutorial, the critical point is that having a standard representation ends up\nbeing a bridge that connects many front ends with many backends. This shared\ninterface removes the need to create a compiler for every combination of\nlanguage and machine architecture. It is a simple but very empowering trick!\n\nBuidKit\nImages, unlike executables, have their own isolated filesystem. Nevertheless,\nthe task of building an image looks very similar to compiling an executable.\nThey can have varying syntax (dockerfile1.0, dockerfile1.2), and the result must\ntarget several machine architectures (arm64 vs. x86_64).\n\n> \"LLB is to Dockerfile what LLVM IR is to C\" - BuildKit Readme\n[https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/README.md]\n\n\nThis similarity was not lost on the BuildKit creators. BuildKit has its own\nintermediate representation, LLB. And where LLVM IR has things like function\ncalls and garbage-collection strategies, LLB has mounting filesystems and\nexecuting statements.\n\n\n\nLLB\n[https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/ebd98bcbe600c662a72ce9725417540f277be4d6/solver/pb/ops.proto] \nis defined as a protocol buffer, and this means that BuildKit frontends can make\nGRPC requests against buildkitd to build a container directly.\n\n\n\nProgrammatically Making An Image\nAlright, enough background. Let's programmatically generate the LLB for an image\nand then build an image.\n\nℹ️ Using GoIn this example, we will be using Go which lets us leverage existing\nBuildKit libraries, but it's possible to accomplish this in any language with\nProtocol Buffer support.Import LLB defintions:\n\nimport (\n\t\"github.com/moby/buildkit/client/llb\"\n)\n\n\nCreate LLB for an Alpine image:\n\nfunc createLLBState() llb.State {\n\treturn llb.Image(\"docker.io/library/alpine\").\n\t\tFile(llb.Copy(llb.Local(\"context\"), \"README.md\", \"README.md\")).\n\t\tRun(llb.Args([]string{\"/bin/sh\", \"-c\", \"echo \\\"programmatically built\\\" > /built.txt\"})).\n    Root()\n}\n\n\n\nWe are accomplishing the equivalent of a FROM by using llb.Image. Then, we copy\na file from the local file system into the image using File and Copy. Finally,\nwe RUN a command to echo some text to a file. LLB has many more operations, but\nyou can recreate many standard images with these three building blocks.\n\nThe final thing we need to do is turn this into protocol-buffer and emit it to\nstandard out:\n\nfunc main() {\n\n\tdt, err := createLLBState().Marshal(context.TODO(), llb.LinuxAmd64)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tpanic(err)\n\t}\n\tllb.WriteTo(dt, os.Stdout)\n}\n\n\nLet's look at the what this generates using the dump-llb option of buildctl:\n\n go run ./writellb/writellb.go | \\\n buildctl debug dump-llb | \\\n jq .\n\n\n\nWe get this JSON formatted LLB:\n\n{\n  \"Op\": {\n    \"Op\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"identifier\": \"local://context\",\n        \"attrs\": {\n          \"local.unique\": \"s43w96rwjsm9tf1zlxvn6nezg\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"constraints\": {}\n  },\n  \"Digest\": \"sha256:c3ca71edeaa161bafed7f3dbdeeab9a5ab34587f569fd71c0a89b4d1e40d77f6\",\n  \"OpMetadata\": {\n    \"caps\": {\n      \"source.local\": true,\n      \"source.local.unique\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"Op\": {\n    \"Op\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"identifier\": \"docker-image://docker.io/library/alpine:latest\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"platform\": {\n      \"Architecture\": \"amd64\",\n      \"OS\": \"linux\"\n    },\n    \"constraints\": {}\n  },\n  \"Digest\": \"sha256:665ba8b2cdc0cb0200e2a42a6b3c0f8f684089f4cd1b81494fbb9805879120f7\",\n  \"OpMetadata\": {\n    \"caps\": {\n      \"source.image\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"Op\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:665ba8b2cdc0cb0200e2a42a6b3c0f8f684089f4cd1b81494fbb9805879120f7\",\n        \"index\": 0\n      },\n      {\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:c3ca71edeaa161bafed7f3dbdeeab9a5ab34587f569fd71c0a89b4d1e40d77f6\",\n        \"index\": 0\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Op\": {\n      \"file\": {\n        \"actions\": [\n          {\n            \"input\": 0,\n            \"secondaryInput\": 1,\n            \"output\": 0,\n            \"Action\": {\n              \"copy\": {\n                \"src\": \"/README.md\",\n                \"dest\": \"/README.md\",\n                \"mode\": -1,\n                \"timestamp\": -1\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"platform\": {\n      \"Architecture\": \"amd64\",\n      \"OS\": \"linux\"\n    },\n    \"constraints\": {}\n  },\n  \"Digest\": \"sha256:ba425dda86f06cf10ee66d85beda9d500adcce2336b047e072c1f0d403334cf6\",\n  \"OpMetadata\": {\n    \"caps\": {\n      \"file.base\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"Op\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:ba425dda86f06cf10ee66d85beda9d500adcce2336b047e072c1f0d403334cf6\",\n        \"index\": 0\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Op\": {\n      \"exec\": {\n        \"meta\": {\n          \"args\": [\n            \"/bin/sh\",\n            \"-c\",\n            \"echo \\\"programmatically built\\\" > /built.txt\"\n          ],\n          \"cwd\": \"/\"\n        },\n        \"mounts\": [\n          {\n            \"input\": 0,\n            \"dest\": \"/\",\n            \"output\": 0\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    \"platform\": {\n      \"Architecture\": \"amd64\",\n      \"OS\": \"linux\"\n    },\n    \"constraints\": {}\n  },\n  \"Digest\": \"sha256:d2d18486652288fdb3516460bd6d1c2a90103d93d507a9b63ddd4a846a0fca2b\",\n  \"OpMetadata\": {\n    \"caps\": {\n      \"exec.meta.base\": true,\n      \"exec.mount.bind\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n{\n  \"Op\": {\n    \"inputs\": [\n      {\n        \"digest\": \"sha256:d2d18486652288fdb3516460bd6d1c2a90103d93d507a9b63ddd4a846a0fca2b\",\n        \"index\": 0\n      }\n    ],\n    \"Op\": null\n  },\n  \"Digest\": \"sha256:fda9d405d3c557e2bd79413628a435da0000e75b9305e52789dd71001a91c704\",\n  \"OpMetadata\": {\n    \"caps\": {\n      \"constraints\": true,\n      \"platform\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nLooking through the output, we can see how our code maps to LLB.\n\nHere is our Copy as part of a FileOp:\n\n    \"Action\": {\n              \"copy\": {\n                \"src\": \"/README.md\",\n                \"dest\": \"/README.md\",\n                \"mode\": -1,\n                \"timestamp\": -1\n              }\n\n\nHere is mapping our build context for use in our COPY command:\n\n  \"Op\": {\n      \"source\": {\n        \"identifier\": \"local://context\",\n        \"attrs\": {\n          \"local.unique\": \"s43w96rwjsm9tf1zlxvn6nezg\"\n        }\n      }\n\n\nSimilarly, the output contains LLB that corresponds to our RUN and FROM \ncommands.\n\nBuilding Our LLB\nTo build our image, we must first start buildkitd:\n\ndocker run --rm --privileged -d --name buildkit moby/buildkit\nexport BUILDKIT_HOST=docker-container://buildkit\n\n\nWe can then build our image like this:\n\ngo run ./writellb/writellb.go | \\\nbuildctl build \\\n--local context=. \\\n--output type=image,name=docker.io/agbell/test,push=true\n\n\nThe output flag lets us specify what backend we want BuildKit to use. We will\nask it to build an OCI image and push it to docker.io.\n\nℹ️ Real-World UsageIn the real-world tool, we might want to programmatically\nmake sure buildkitd is running and send the RPC request directly to it, as well\nas provide friendly error messages. For tutorial purposes, we will skip all\nthat.We can run it like this:\n\n> docker run -it --pull always agbell/test:latest /bin/sh\n\n\n\nAnd we can then see the results of our programmatic COPY and RUN commands:\n\n/ # cat built.txt \nprogrammatically built\n/ # ls README.md\nREADME.md\n\n\nThere we go! The full code example\n[https://github.com/agbell/compiling-containers/blob/main/writellb/writellb.go] \ncan be a great starting place for your own programmatic docker image building.\n\nA True Frontend for BuildKit\nA true compiler front end does more than just emit hardcoded IR. A proper\nfrontend takes in files, tokenizes them, parses them, generates a syntax tree,\nand then lowers that syntax tree into the internal representation. Mockerfiles\n[https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend/] are an example of\nsuch a frontend:\n\n#syntax=r2d4/mocker\napiVersion: v1alpha1\nimages:\n- name: demo\n  from: ubuntu:16.04\n  package:\n    install:\n    - curl\n    - git\n    - gcc\n\n\nAnd because Docker build supports the #syntax command we can even build a\nMockerfiles directly with docker build.\n\ndocker build -f mockerfile.yaml\n\n\nTo support the #syntax command, all that is needed is to put the frontend in a\ndocker image that accepts a GRPC request in the correct format, publish that\nimage somewhere. At that point, anyone can use your frontend docker build by\njust using #syntax=yourimagename.\n\nBuilding Our Own Example Frontend for Docker build\nBuilding a tokenizer and a parser as a GRPC service is beyond the scope of this\narticle. But we can get our feet wet by extracting and modifying an existing\nfrontend. The standard dockerfile frontend\n[https://github.com/moby/buildkit/tree/master/frontend/dockerfile] is easy to\ndisentangle from the moby project. I've pulled the relevant parts out into a \nstand-alone repo\n[https://github.com/agbell/compiling-containers/tree/main/ickfile]. Let's make\nsome trivial modifications to it and test it out.\n\nSo far, we've only used the docker commands FROM, RUN and COPY. At a surface\nlevel, with its capitalized commands, Dockerfile syntax looks a lot like the\nprogramming language INTERCAL\n[/intercal-yaml-and-other-horrible-programming-languages/]. Let change these\ncommands to their INTERCAL equivalent and develop our own Ickfile format [2].\n\nDockerfileIckfileFROMCOME FROMRUNPLEASECOPYSTASHThe modules in the dockerfile\nfrontend split the parsing of the input file into several discreet steps, with\nexecution flowing this way:\n\n\n\nFor this tutorial, we are only going to make trivial changes to the frontend. We\nwill leave all the stages intact and focus on customizing the existing commands\nto our tastes. To do this, all we need to do is change command.go:\n\npackage command\n\n// Define constants for the command strings\nconst (\n\tCopy        = \"stash\"\n\tRun         = \"please\"\n\tFrom        = \"come_from\"\n\t...\n)\n\n\nThen we build our image:\n\ndocker build . -t agbell/ick\n\n\nAnd we can use this image as a BuildKit frontend and build images with it like\nthis:\n\n#syntax=agbell/ick\nCOME_FROM alpine\nSTASH README.md README.md\nPLEASE echo \"custom frontend built\" > /built.txt\"\n\n\n\nDOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -f ./Ickfile -t ick \n\n\nAnd we can run it just like any other image:\n\n> docker run -it ick /bin/sh\n\n\nAnd we can then see results of our STASH and PLEASE commands:\n\n/ # cat built.txt \ncustom frontend built\n/ # ls README.md\nREADME.md\n\n\nI've pushed this image to dockerhub. Anyone can start building images using our \nickfile format by adding #syntax=agbell/ick to an existing Dockerfile. No manual\ninstallation is required!\n\nℹ️ Enabling BuildKitBuildKit is included but not enabled by default in the\ncurrent version of Docker (version 20.10.2). To instruct docker build to use\nBuildKit set the following environment variable DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1. This will not\nbe necessary once BuildKit reaches general availability.Conclusion\nWe have learned that a three-phased structure borrowed from compilers powers\nbuilding images, that an intermediate representation called LLB is the key to\nthat structure. Empowered by the knowledge, we have produced two frontends for\nbuilding images.\n\nThis deep dive on frontends still leaves much to explore. If you want to learn\nmore, I suggest looking into BuildKit workers. Workers do the actual building\nand are the secret behind docker buildx, and multi-archtecture builds\n[https://docs.docker.com/buildx/working-with-buildx/]. docker build also has\nsupport for remote workers and cache mounts, both of which can lead to faster\nbuilds.\n\nEarthly [http://earthly.dev/] uses BuildKit internally for its repeatable build\nsyntax. Without it, our containerized Makefile-like syntax would not be\npossible. If you want a saner CI process, then you should check it out\n[http://earthly.dev/].\n\nThere is also much more to explore about how modern compilers work. Modern\ncompilers often have many stages and more than one intermediate representation,\nand they are often able to do very sophisticated optimizations.[3]\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n 1. Fun Fact: You may have heard the term transpiler or transcompiler in the\n    past. Transpilers are compilers that transform one programming language into\n    another. If all compilers translate from one language to another, then what\n    makes something a transpiler?\n    \n    The difference between the two is murky, but I like to think of a transpiler\n    as something that translates from one human-readable text-based programming\n    language to another. The java compiler translates Java code to java byte\n    code, which is a binary format. Meanwhile, PureScript, which translates to\n    JavaScript, is regarded as a transpiler because JavaScript is text-based. ↩︎\n    \n    \n 2. Ick is the name of the INTERCAL compiler. Therefore Ickfile can be its\n    Dockerfile equivalent. ↩︎\n    \n    \n 3. If you want to learn more about optimizing compilers, Matt Godbolt's article\n    on C++ Optimizations [https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3372264] is a\n    great place to start. The book Building an Optimizing Compiler\n    [https://www.amazon.com/Building-Optimizing-Compiler-Bob-Morgan/dp/155558179X] \n    is also often recommended online.
