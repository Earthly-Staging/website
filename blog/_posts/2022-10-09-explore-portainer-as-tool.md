As a developer managing containerized applications can be daunting especially when it comes to using a command-line interface; administrating [docker](/blog/rails-with-docker) containers, writing complicating, and having to learn the various commands can be intimidating.

Depending on where you land on the spectrum, you might have no problem using a command-line interface; but for many folks, it's a challenge.

[Portainer](https://github.com/portainer/portainer) is an open-source service that provides a visual web view for containerized applications. it is a container management tool for Docker, Docker swarm, Kubernetes, and [Azure](/blog/continuous-integration) Container Instances (ACI).

Portainer gives you the ability to deploy and manage your docker containers without having to write code like you'll normally do with a CLI. With portainer, you have the flexibility of viewing your containerized apps and managing them via a graphical user interface.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up, create, and manage [docker](/blog/rails-with-docker) containers and images with Portainer.

## What Is Portainer

Portainer is a containerized web app for managing containerized apps. It gives you a user interface to manage your containerized applications for both local and cloud environments. This reduces the need for command line interfaces.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Portainer comes in [two types](https://www.portainer.io/pricing-new) - the portainer community edition (portainer-ce) and the portainer business edition (portainer-ee). This tutorial uses the portainer community edition.

</aside>

The portainer architecture requires that you first deploy a portainer server. This server will serve as a central point of operation. You can have the portainer server running on a virtual machine or on a kubernetes cluster as a docker container.

## Prerequisites

In this tutorial, you will need the following.

- Docker installed on a ubuntu linux machine.
- Basic knowledge of Docker.

(If you don't use ubuntu, you can probably adapt these instructions to your distro of choice)

## Setting Up Portainer for Docker

First up, you will deploy a portainer app as a docker container to administrate and manage your docker containerized applications.

Since portainer runs as a containerized application, it is required that you create a docker container, configure the volume for persistent storage of the portainer server, and assign port number bindings.

Run the command below to configure a volume called `portainer-data` :

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker volume create portainer-data
~~~

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Portainer community edition comes with three different environment versions - A kubernetes environment, a Docker swarm environment and a Docker standalone environment and Azure container instance environment. This tutorial uses a Docker standalone environment.

</aside>

Install the portainer Docker standalone version using the command below:

This command will create a docker container called `portainer-ce` and run the portainer server in a detached mode.

It will also expose both port 9443 and 8000 and map it to the port 9443 and 8000, respectively. The port binding 9443 gives you access to the portainer GUI, and the port binding 8000 is for the tunneling that enables the connection between the edge agent and the portainer server.

Additionally, this command will mount the docker sock to mount local [docker](/blog/rails-with-docker) containers and Mount the volume `portainer-data` to persist data.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -p 9443:9443 --name portainer-ce --restart=always -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer-data:/data portainer/portainer-ce:latest
~~~

## Accessing the Portainer UI

Portainer becomes really useful and powerful when used via the GUI. Since you now have portainer up and running, visit the address below on your favorite browser to access your login page. You'll need to create a user and log in so you can access the portainer GUI to administer your containers.

~~~{.bash caption=">_"}
https://localhost:9443
~~~

You should see a page that requires you to create a user to proceed. Fill in the fields, to create a user.

Right here in your dashboard, you also have the flexibility to add a docker container, delete a docker container, add a volume, delete a volume as well as docker compose stacks, images, and networks without having to use a command-line interface or write code.

On the right panel in your dashboard, navigate to the *containers* option **to view your docker containers.

On the containers page, you should see all the containers available on your machine. You also can *start,stop,kill,restart, pause,resume,remove* as well as *add a new docker container.*

The image below showcases all docker containers available locally; both the ones that are running and stopped together with their ip-addresses and ports exposed if available.

To add a docker container, click on the *add container* button and the page would then navigate to a *create container* page where you can specify some configuration settings for the container you want to create.

For testing, â€Œset the container name to *Nginx-web-server* and populate the image field with the value - *nginx.* You'll need to do this because you will deploy a Nginx web server.

Also, toggle the ***Publish all exposed network ports to random host ports*** so portainer can assign random host ports to the network port â€Œthe container exposes.

![Creating and configuring (Nginx) docker container](https://imgur.com/fcxETJN)

Creating and configuring (Nginx) docker container

Toggle both the *always pull the image* and *auto-remove* configuration setting so that portainer constantly gets the latest version of the image, and then stops and remove any existing instance of the container, respectively.

Finally, scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the *Deploy container* button to create this container.

On the *environment* page, â€Œclick on the *Add environment* button to add an environment.

You can see that portainer supports Docker, Kubernetes, and ACI environments. Go ahead and click on the *Kubernetes box*  to a add and manage a Kubernetes environment and click on the *start wizard* button to continue.

![Adding Kubernetes environment](https://imgur.com/wwGx326)

Adding Kubernetes environment

A new screen with other configuration settings will be shown to you:

![Configuring Kubernetes environment](https://imgur.com/7AtxDj2)

Configuring Kubernetes environment

While connecting to Kubernetes clusters, portainer provides three different options. Connecting through a default agent, an edge agent or import an existing kubernetes config.

The default agent is used to communicate and manage local Kubernetes cluster resources. while the edge agent is used for connecting production or cloud based Kubernetes environments on public networks which is done via an encrypted TLS tunnel to prevent the edge agent from being public. This applies to local and cloud based Docker swarm clusters and Azure container instances (ACI) as well.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ If you will run local networks or run docker containers locally on your machine then it's suitable to use the portainer default agent. But if you will be running portainer in the cloud, then portainer will have a public endpoint. So, in this case you'll need to use the portainer edge agent.

</aside>

For connecting Kubernetes clusters (either local or cloud environments) a portainer agent is required to be deployed on the Kubernetes cluster via node port and load balancer. Here, all you need to do is copy the command highlighted to install the portainer agent. This agent serves and a means of communication between the Kubernetes environment and the portainer server.

This Kubernetes environment can either be running on your local machine or a virtual machine other than the host (the linux server or your local machine) the portainer server is running on.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Adding an environment is beyond the scope of this tutorial. If you'd like to learn more on how you can add an environment visit, the [portainer documentation](https://docs.portainer.io/admin/environments/add/kubernetes) as it is required that you have either a local or could-based kubernetes cluster or docker swarm cluster up and running.
